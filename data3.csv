We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try,Get along while we can

Drink a beer, sing a song

Wondered was she photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?,Get along, on down the road

You can hear the cries from the carnival rides, the pinball bells, and the skee ball slots
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight,There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the street
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hand
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet,And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be
Anything but mine,There's a local band playing at the seaside pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing, Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin,In the midst of the music
I tell her I love her
And we both laugh, cause we know it isn't true
Oh, but Mary, there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you,But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be

You can't flip it over and start again

With the sunshine on my face
Saint Christopher on a silver chain
Say a prayer and sail away,Ooh, one of these days
Gonna get off of this highway
Wake up in Sun Bay
With the sunshine on my face
Saint Christopher on a silver chain
Say a prayer and sail away,I wish I was pirate on some gold ship in the night
With nothing but the stars, the moon and faith to be my guise
Steady as she goes with my back to the wind
Let a cloud of cannon smoke, I disappear again"

Til he lost his wife Jo
Now forty feet of sail antique

In the middle of a hurricane
Came out alive on the other side
That's where The Other Side got its name,Boats

Was all that Tom could take
Sitting at his desk
All alone and depressed
Says this just can't be my fate
Went home that night and told his wife

It's been real but it ain't been fun
Gonna get us one of them,Boats

And took it all the way to the end of the line.
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip,I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl,Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willin' and able
Don't know what makes you say ""What the hell""
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something 'bout it makes her just wanna dance

Tucked back in the woods, yea life was good

That's when I first met Jose
He had a twelve foot Schooner
A three foot cooler
Full of the catch of the day
And he was wrinkled from grinning
From all of the sun he had been in
He was barefoot, cerveza in hand
He said ""Gracias senor"" when I paid him too much for
All of the snapper he had
Now I told him my friend it ain't nothing
In the best broken Spanish I knew
I said I make a good living
Back home where I'm from
He smiled and said ""amigo me too"",He said I fish and I play my guitar
I laugh at the bar with my friends
I go home to my wife
I pray every night
I can do it all over again,Somewhere over Texas
I thought of my Lexus
And all the stuff I work so hard for
And all the things that I've gathered
From climbing that ladder
Didn't make much sense anymore
They say my nest egg ain't ready to hatch yet
They keep holding my feet to the fire
They call it paying the price
So that one day in life
I'll have what I need to retire,And just fish and play my guitar
And laugh at the bar with my friends
And go home to my wife
And pray every night
I can do it all over again,And to think that I thought for a while there that I had it made
When the truth is I'm really just dying
To live like Jose,And just fish
Play my guitar
Laugh at the bar with my friends
Go home to my wife
Pray every night
I can do it all over again,Wouldn't that be the life
Wouldn't that be the life"

Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life where it's goin, where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield, but nothing compares
To the way that I see it,
to the way that I see it,
to the way that I see it when I sit in that old blue chair,From that chair I've caught a few fish and some rays
And I've watched boats sail in and out of cinnamon bay
I let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart
I prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start,I've read a lot of books,
Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life where it's goin, where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windeshield, but nothing compares
To the way that I see it, to the way that I see it,
to the way that I see it when I sit in

When i passed out from too much Cruzan and Diet
And woke up to a hundred mesquito bites,
I swear got 'em all sittin right there
In that old blue chair,There's a blue rockin chair

Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher

I grew up in east Tennessee
Well last night I was everything

Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done,Yeah, we went out last night

Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night,Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight,Oh, we went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Everybody started loving on each other,They were dancing on the tables and howling at the moon
Pairing up together and pretty soon
There was not a soul in sight

Save it for a rainy day,When I turned the ignition
I knew I'd be missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit,Wondering what happened
Two days of taking all the blame
Got a drink, or two,
That's as fool proof as what it will be
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kind of making eyes at me,Cause the sun's too bright,
The sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day,Yeah, the music's too good,
My friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you
I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day,They'll be plenty of time for ones and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait,Cause the sun's too bright,
The sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day,Yeah, the music's too good,
My friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you
I've got nothing to say

Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some livin', yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I, haven't done,Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonight's the night, feels like perfect timin'
Down on one knee on momma's front steps
Man I'm gonna die if she really says yes

Drivin' my first love out to the levy
Livin' life with no sense of time
An' I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks,Every time I hear that song
I go back, I go back,I used to rock all night long to, ""Keep On Rockin' Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song,An' I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on the Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks,Every time I hear that song
I go back, I go back,We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time,So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks,Every time I hear that song
I go back, I go back,To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back

Growin' up too fast and I do recall
I go back

At one of those meetings down at the Y,Well, they started talkin bout steps you take
Mistakes you make
The hearts you break
And the price you pay
I almost walked away,You could hear a pin drop
When this old man
Stood up and said I'm gonna' say it again
Like I do every week
For those who don't know me,It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yah, I've been there, that's why I'm here,This ole boy stood up in the aisle
Said he'd been living a life of denial
And he cried as he talked about wasted years
I couldn't believe what I heard

I'm looking for,I could climb a hundred mountains

Where does he take a broken heart
Shouldn't there be some small exemption
If he does all that it takes
To admit to his mistakes
'Til the truth batters and breaks his world apart,I could ask for my forgiveness
From the heavens high above
Tell myself my prayers
Are gonna somehow be enough
Then lay down in some angel's bed
Convinced I've found the one I'm dreaming of,But it's always gonna be you
Always gonna be you
That I love,Where does a man seek his salvation
When does his mind finally go free
Is the pain he feels the only explanation
For believing lies are true
For the stone inside a shoe
The endless ways you keep haunting me,I could find an empty church
Get down on my knees
Tell myself that mercy is a matter of degrees
Then lay down in some angel's arms
Convinced I've found the one I'm dreaming of,But it's always gonna be you
Always gonna be you

And drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel
Was all I could think about,A little rust in the bed of that truck
And a four speed on the floor
Five hundred dollars it was mine, all mine
And I never wanted nothing more,I took Katie down by the river
With a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool tryin' to play it cool
Hopin' she'd let me cross the line,And I was prayin' that she couldn't tell
I'd never been that far before
The first time's a one time feeling
And I never wanted nothin' more
Naw I never wanted nothin' more,Well, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
And I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need,My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told them that I thought it through
Well, Katie laughed and my momma cried
When they heard me say,? I do?,Her little ring was a little thing
But it was all that I could afford
Now she's mine all mine till the day I die
And I never wanted nothing more
Naw I never wanted nothing more,Well, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
And I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need,One Sunday I listened to the preacher
And I knew he was preaching to me
I couldn't help it, I walked up front
And I got down on my knees,Right then and there I swear
I changed when I found the Lord
Glory Hallelujah, Good God Almighty
I never wanted nothing more
Naw I never wanted nothing more,Well, I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
And I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need,I never wanted nothing more
And I never wanted nothing more"

To let the music take us away
Take our minds to a better place,Where we feel that sense of freedom
Leave our worries behind, we don't need 'em

Never did change, stayed strange, hopped a train
My first chance I got out of SmallVille
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?,My first stop was a pawn shop
Dropped a pretty penny for a cheap fender with a song in it
I had a quick right hand, and an old band
I thought good friends would make a good band
Life has it's way of provin' you wrong, don't it?,I've been right and I've been wrong
Somewhere in between for so long
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?,So there I was, a long way from nowhere
Frightened mind, spare time and a blank stare
I was just numb enough not to feel a thang
After all we didn't share a set of rings
Besides, how bad could it be!
She never found out I'd never come clean
Life has it's way of leadin' you on, don't it?,I've been right and I've been wrong
Somewhere in between for so long
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?,Well now, have you ever been down the old back road?
On-Time ballroom
It's a trip, it's a bitch, it's an on and off light switch
Nobody follows
Everybody's got their own past
Skeletons to stash, don't look back if you do laugh

I told the preacher, ""Yes I do""
But I hope they don't call today

Have a mansion high above the clouds

Throw an extra twenty in the plate
There's one for everything I did last night
And one to get me through today
Here's a ten to help you remember
Next time you got the good Lord's ear
Say I'm comin' but there ain't no hurry
I'm havin' fun down here
Don't you know that,Everybody wants to go to heaven
Get their wings and fly around
Everybody want to go to heaven

But I wouldn't mind waiting at least a hundred years or so,Everybody wanna go to heaven

with a tear in her eye,
she looked at me,
it was the moment of truth,
i was scared to death.
my life hung on what that tear meant,
then she smiled at me,
and i lost it.

make me laugh,

Well the honeymoon ended,
and life began,
jobs and bills,
losing touch with friends,
and the apartment
got smaller every day.
then one night,
the walls finally closed in,
i came home late,
she said ""where have you been?
you used to call and tell me,
you're on your way.""
she said,
""if this is how this is gonna be,
then i quit.""
she walked out the door,
i lost it.

Right there on that Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more

second no one knew if it was caught 
We heard 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see
Touchdown Tennessee,Your voice painted us a picture of all the losses and the wins
And it's so hard to imagine a game without your voice again
Saying 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see

Where Mama used to measure us
I'm proud to say that's my home where I was raised
But that ain't where I grew up,See, I gained a little on Father Time
The summer my Granddaddy died
The first time I saw Mama cry
Man, that sure was tough,Felt like I put on a few years
Watching Daddy wipe her tears
In my little coat and tie standing in that cemetery mud
That's where I grew up,My senior year, a case of beer out on the river bank
Getting a head start on twenty one
That's the place that made me feel just like a man
But that ain't where I grew up, no,See I gained a little on Father Time
That night I crossed that center line
I bet I rolled a dozen times
Next thing I knew I was,Waking up upside down
Praying God just get me out
Then I hit my knees beside what was left of my truck
Hey, that's where I grew up,You learn as you go, that's how you grow,See, I gained a little on Father Time
When me and her, had our first big fight
I said some things, I made her cry
She packed all her stuff,The boy in me said let her go
But the man in me said pull her close
It was time to find out which one I was
Standing in a doorway holding on to love,That's where I grew up
Oh, that's where I grew up"

Mistakes you make, the hearts you break
And the price you pay, I almost walked away
And you could hear a pin drop when this old man
Stood up and said, ""I'm gonna' say it again like I do every week
For those who don't know me"",It's the simple things in life like the kids at home and a loving wife

Said he'd been living a life of denial
And he cried as he talked about wasted years
I couldn't believe what I heard
It was my life word for word
And all of the sudden it was clear,It's the simple things in life like the kids at home and a loving wife

He didn't pour me a beer.

And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate,
'Cos your hands are shakin' so much.
An' it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair.
Eatin' burtn suppers the first whole year
An' askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up.
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff.,He grabbed a carton of milk an' her poured a glass.
An' I smiled an' said: ""I'll have some of that.""
We sat there an' talked as an hour passed,
Like old friends.,I saw a black an' white picture an' it caught my stare,
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair.
He said: ""That's my Bonnie,
Taken 'bout a year after we were wed."",He said ""Spent five years in the bar,
When the cancer took her from me.
But I've been sober three years now,
'Cos the one thing stronger than the whiskey:,Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl.
The way she adored that string of pearls,
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl,
Married his high school love.
An' it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'.
Bein' right there as our time got small,
An' holdin' her hand, when the Good Lord called her up,
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff.,He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry.""
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I.'

Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz,Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head,Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want ya dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he can't pay, ya'll can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while ya'll washin' watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know this dude's ballin' but yea that's nice
And they gone keep callin' and tryin'
But you stay right girl
But when you get on he leave yo' ass for a white girl
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head

Hey, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it
On girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit

Let's have a threesome with you and the blunt

Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?,Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example,Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands,The best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm about to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get
Ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said
""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gonna do now?""
Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus,Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass,Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands,Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is,None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen,I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up,Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands,Pull up in the monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
OK, first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'm a start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do,Hair dresser from Milan that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe,Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbiez got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki cause she's fake
She on a diet but her pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster,I crossed the limelight
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am headed home
I crossed the limelight
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am headed home
I crossed the limelight
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am headed home"

The clock's ticking', I just count the hours
Stop tripping', I'm tripping' off the power

Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he so, fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin' up with me,Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for its custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
Thinkin', no one man should have all that power,The clock's tickin', I just count the hours

At the end of day, goddammit I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick

She has no idea what she's doing in college,That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure,Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like f**k it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care,She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve,And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe

C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down

It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem,The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres,And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe,C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down
who u gonna acall now
C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em,We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need em
The things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth,That's why shorties holler, ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealers buy Jordans, crackheads buy crack
But the white man get paid off of all a dat
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou,Cause f**k it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down,
South side, south side,
We gon' set this party off right,
West side, west side,
We gon' set this party off right.
Chi-Town, Chi-Town,
We gon' show em how we get down."

And you say Chi City
Chi City, Chi City,I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again, 'min' home again,I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Wendy and I like to blow trees"",And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from outta town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their act 'cause she know they soft,And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime my face lit up, so astoundin'
And I told her in my heart is where she always be
She never mess with entertainers 'cause they always leave,She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess it's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""Ye
Keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"",(I'm comin' home again)
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again, 'min' home again,Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we could start again,But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport
To follow your dream, sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' about me,She said, ""You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new"",Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess this is why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home,Every interview I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
And if you don't know by now, I'm talkin' about Chi Town,(I'm comin' home again)
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again, 'min' home again
Baby, do you remember when fireworks at Lake Michigan?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again, 'min' home again
Baby, do you remember when fireworks at Lake Michigan?
Oh, now I'm comin' home again, maybe we could start again
Loyee, oyee, oh, loyee, oyee, oh
Comin' home again
Loyee, oyee, oh, loyee, oyee, oh
Comin' home again
Maybe we could start again"

It was all part of the story

Thank you for all of the glory
You will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)

Father forgive me,
I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster

I'm just being silly

Nigga do we have a problem?
Matter of fact Marlin, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No daddy don't play
Not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress
I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death,Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she's in
If you whip her ass, she move in with him
Then he whip her ass
You go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?,Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas,
But yesterday is dead, yeah
Moment of silence
Next she'll be off to college
And then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage
Niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps
Niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps
Niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters,Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried

But now I'm out and I'm free to love what I want
Be it Yellow Fin or Bass or them trout in Vermont

To whom much is given much is tested,Get arrested guess until he get the message,I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V

She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty

Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation

Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey),I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you something to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?

Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept,I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party

And I start to blame myself, somebody help,Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure,You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking, and choking you,What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine,And you ain't fixin' to see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other nigga's stroking you
Lie and say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?,You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone, like what was I supposed to do?,Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers,I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy, I ain't your right, girl
You'll probably find one of them ""I like art"" type girls,All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained,Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure,Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies,We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity, we erased one another
So far from where we came with so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?,Lack of visual empathy
Equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell,Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure,I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much,And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just rang and rang
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing,I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing,Oh, my God, baby, you done took this shit to the 'nother motherfucking level
Now a neighborhood nigga like me
Ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
God damn, god damn,Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga? Yeezy taught me
You never used to talk dirty, but now you, you god damn disgusting
My, my God, wh-wh-where'd you learn that? Yeezy taught me,Look at you motherfucking butt-ass naked
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choo's on
Who thought you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choo's on?
Yeezy taught me,Yo, you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level
This is some Cirque Du Soleil pussy now, shit
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay?
And I, I, I, I love it, and I thank you,I thank you, my dick thanks you
How did you learn, how di-
How did your pussy game come up?
Yeezy taught me
I was fucking parts of your pussy
I never fucked before
I was in there like, ""Oh shit I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before""
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga I'ma thank him
I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker
I'ma shoot a bootlegger, that's how good I feel about this nigga
Oh, I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker's the exact motherfucker I wanted
With the bezel, this is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it
Twista had this shit on in The Source, I remember
Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source
That's right, that's right
Yo, yo, babe, yo, yo, this is the best birthday ever
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
Yeezy taught me
Yeezy taught you well
Yeezy taught you well"

You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans
Now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range
Beat it up like Rampage

Yeah I'm talking Ye', yeah I'm talking Rih', yeah I'm talking B, nigga I'm talking me.

Call me Hov or jefe.
Translation, I'm the shit.
Least that what my neck say, least that what my check say.
Lost my homie for a decade, nigga down for like 12 years, ain't hug his son since the second grade.
He never told, who we gonna tell, we top of the totem pole.
It's the dream team meets the supreme team, and all our eyes green and only means one thing.
You ain't fuckin' with my clique.
Break records at Louis.
Ate breakfast at Gucci.
My girl a superstar all from a home movie.
Bow on our arrival the unamerican idols.
What niggas did in Paris got em hanging off the Eiffel.
Yeah I'm talking businessWe talking CIA.
I'm talking George Tenet.
I seen him the other day.
He asked me about my Maybach.
Think he had the same.
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented.
You know white people get money don't spend it.
Or maybe they get money, buy a business.
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig'nant.
I know Spike Lee gon kill me but let me finish.
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limitsThem gold master p ceilings was just a figment.
Of our imagination, MTV cribs.
Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives.
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse.
He wasn't really drunk he just had a few brews.
Pass the refreshment a cool cool beverage.
Everything I do need a news crew presence.
Speed Boat swerve homie, watch out for the wavesI'm way too black to burn from sun rays.
So I just meditated the home in Pompeii.
About how I could build a new Rome in one day.
Every time I'm in Vegas they screaming like he's Elvis.
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it.
Shit is real got me feelin' Isrealian.
Like Bar Refaeli Gisele, no that's Brazilian.
Went through deep depression when my momma passed.
Suicide what kind of talk is that.
But I've been talking to God for so long
That if have you look in my life I guess he talking back.

This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats

Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro,Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost

Middle finger in the air if you don't really care

Baby you're fired, your girlfriend hired
And if you don't mind I'm'a keep you on call,We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all

Burning their little bridges, fucking ridiculous,Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous,Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is, fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous,Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mill in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer the legend I've become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one,Blackjack I just pulled in aces
You looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream muthafuckers I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith,Range Rove leather roof, love war fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with mother goose
Them hoes coming in a bakers dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't,I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness,I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more,Them kilo's came we gave you bobby brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legend of the falls
Spillin' I own you all, yeah,One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes this shit ridiculous,One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous,I am so outrageous,
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places,The favorite, huh, my cup over runneth with hundreds
Dummy, dammit, not like for me to waste it
The new commandment, thou shall not hate kid
My movement is like the civil rights I'm Ralph David,Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas baby those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day fucked her in May
She found out about April so she chose to March,Damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my dro the mark
Plus a trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart,G-A-T in the pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PHDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods don't make me grab iron,Ay yo champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous,Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous,One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes this shit ridiculous,One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous"

I spit it through the wire man
It's too much stuff on my heart right now, man

It's a life or death situation, man,Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-Town what's going on
Uh huh, yeah, yeah
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork,How do you console my mom or give her light support,Telling her, her sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmit Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
I'm use to trying to reline
I've been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making man,I really apologize how I sound right now man
If this ain't clear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said like six weeks,You know we had reconstru...
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw,I looked in the mirror, half of my jaw was missing from half my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man,This is what I gotta say right here dawg
Yeah, turn me up yeah
Uh,What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time,In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue,I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire,You know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um
I was goin' to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on
You can't be serious man"

You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
it ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean?,And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams,And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm
7: 00, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about?
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?"

It's not many of us, we smile at each other

Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?,Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time

Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him,I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be,Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, to the real end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?

I hate when a nigga text you like, ""what's up, fam, hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good"" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him

God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, you was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow,My life, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent to you, bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between,
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife,Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible
Now I'm visible to you
Oh the invisible truths they sold
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand
Understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here
And stood by me
And look at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above,Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, father, father...)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*

Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move

Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out,(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's trying to break me down

On the minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS

'Till then, walk in his footsteps and try to be him

My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my lil' cousin smokin' them cigarettes now

Cause like a crip said: ""I got way too many blues for any more bad news""
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it I'm going after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever who has it
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, its like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about 2 things, my black balls,Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down,Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly dripping away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down,I know cops, hems is lifting lenses
Kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
Got made code red
Break up the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye,Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down"

freedom is slavery uh
Used to Be Dame and BIG's brother
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin.,It's the hard knock life tour, sell out
Picture us in the mall coppin' iceberg and yell out jigga (jigga)
Yeah that's what we'll yell out (yell out)
You know the name do, i gotta spell out, or tell bout?
J.A.Y., and 'Ye so shy, now he won't even step to his idol to say hi.,Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""he could change your life.""
With all these beats i did, at least let him hear
At least you can brag to your friends back at the gig.
But he got me out my mama' crib,Then he helped me get my mama' a crib.
Big brother was BIG's brother,Used to be Dame and BIG's brother
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend
No I.D my mentor, now let the story begin (begin).
Let the story begin (let the story begin).
If you feel the way i feel, why don't you wave your hands?,Fresh off the plane, I'm off the base line.
Nothin' handed out, I'm bout to take mine.,Round the same time of that Blueprint One, p
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him.
I played my little songs in that old back room
He'd bop his head and say, ""damn, oh thats you?""
But by the black album, i was blackin' out
Partyin S.O.B's and we had packed the crowd.
Big brother got a show up in Madison Square
And I'm like, 'Yeah yeah, we gon' be there!'
But, not only did i not get a chance to spit it.,Carlene told me i could buy two tickets.
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance.
But everything that I felt was more bogus,Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent.
Only thing I wanna know, is why I get looked over
I guess I understand when I get more older.
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem,Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum.
My Big brother was B.I.G's brother,Used to Be Dame and B.I.G's brother
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend,No I.D my mentor, now Let the story begin (begin).
Let the story begin.
If you feel the way i feel, why won't you wave your hands?
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, but the presi-dito.,Hola' Hovito', the game gettin' foul, so here's a free throw.
I was always on the other side of the peephole,Then i dropped Jesus Walks, now I'm on a steeple.
And we know, New Jack City gotta keep my brother
But to be number one, I'ma beat my brother.
On that diamonds remix, I swore I'd spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass!
Sibling rivalry, only I could see, it was the pride in me, that was drivin' me.
At the Grammies I said, ""I inspired me.""
But my big brother who i always tried to be.,When i kicked the flow, it was like pick and roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give and go.
I guess being styled was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll, but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna' mingle yo, (laughs), ya'll know!
I told Jay i did a song with Coldplay
Next thing i know, he got a song with Coldplay.
Back of my mind, I'm like 'damn, no way'
Translate espanol, ""No way Jose!""
Then i went and told Jay Brown
Should have known that was gonna come back around
Should have talked to you like a man, should have told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse.
My big brother, was BIG's brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother.
If you admire somebody, you should go ahead and tell 'em
People never get the flowers, while they can still smell 'em.
A idol in my eyes, god of the game, heart of the city, Roc-a-fella Chain
Never be the same, never be another number one Young Hov, also my big brother.
My Big brother was B.I.G's brother
Used to Be Dame and B.I.G's brother
Who was hip hop brother, who was No I.D Friend
No I.D my mentor, and thats where the story ends..."

So if you gon' do it, do it just like this,Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?,You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted, layaway or a deposit
My daddy'd say ""When you see clothes close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and hey! hey! hey! hey!,Did you realize

I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the drop out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible hey! hey! hey!,Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?,This is the story of a champion
Runners on your mark and they pop the guns!
Stand up, stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?

Then get my head straight
Then give my head great

With penthouse bitches,
See I pimped my crib, so I must exhibit
Shit, these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes
Get realized
I got the same wings angels fly
With Louie Vutton feathers, now that some fly shit,Chorus"

Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama),I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take yall back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama),(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama),Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama),(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama),I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama),Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'mma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama),I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
You know i love you so
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
Nowhere you go our love is true

When I pull the piece out niggas like, ""Peace out"",Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to apologize to Mos and Kweli
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali?,First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped, I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again,And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon, more chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is,I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like

Act now and get some action for 3.99
Later on I might charge for menage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers,And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
'Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug
She asked, ""Can you drive me
And the hunnies to where my Altima was?"",While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand, let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga

When I pull a piece out niggas like, ""Peace out"",I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash,Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages,K, I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink and a handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam,So say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe,Yeah, breathe in, breathe out

Told you four times, don't test me, hoe

He make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?

Yeah me we gon' cook this up (all gold is not reality)
(real is what you live to be),This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why did the guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?

I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em sup
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins,Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg,But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to piss in the bed
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away,Let the sun come out and all the children say
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman,Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
The second she storm out, then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't,We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business

They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)

Turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that, I had for us
Turned my dreams into dust,I know Obama was Heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be President
Yeah you can, at what cost though?
Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?
Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk, though
But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?
Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?
It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against
You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print
You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit
It's bigger than your selfish agenda
If your election ain't gon' stop
police from murderin' niggas, then shit...
Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people
Actually wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal
You gotta see the vantage point of the people
What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil
See that's the problem with this damn nation
All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man,
we ain't made it off the plantation
Fuck who you choose as your political party
You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted
With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position
Don't you feel an obligation to them?
I feel an obligation to show people new ideas
And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here
Make America Great Again had a negative reception
I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction
Added empathy, care and love and affection
And y'all simply questionin' my methods
What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?
This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you
You wore a dusty ass hat to represent the same views
As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you
All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie
Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie
That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down
You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?
I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half
Then one day I was like, ""Fuck it, I'ma do me""
I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me
Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up
Lot of people agree with me, but they too scared to speak up
The greater good of the people is first
Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?
You had a bad idea, and you're makin' it worse
This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church
Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different
Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand
I know everybody emotional
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you, or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich
You'll deal with God for the lack of respect
Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check
Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that
What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?
Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bitch
Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget
And all that free thought shit, find a better defense
But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that
Fuck it
Alright T.I.P., we could be rappin' about this all day,
man, why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?"

And on her 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his,Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz,Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head,Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want ya dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he can't pay, ya'll can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while ya'll washin' watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know this dude's ballin' but yea that's nice
And they gone keep callin' and tryin'
But you stay right girl
But when you get on he leave yo' ass for a white girl
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head

The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Perfect!),Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman,(Yo!),Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, ""Get your money""
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (Yo!)
10 thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (Yo!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (Yo!),I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant,Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman, ah!
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Sonic boom!),Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, this is pure luxury
I give 'em grey poupon on a DJ Mustard, ah!
If you ain't poppin' shit then why you rap for? Haaan?
Plus Kimoji just shut down the app store, ah!
And we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute
(We did)
Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (Yo!)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (Yo!)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?,So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2

You love me when I'm hungover

Skinny bitch with no shoulders

I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine

Dawg i was having nervous breakdowns
Like man these niggas that much better then me?
Baby, Im going on a Aeroplane
And i don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it
Things became diffrent
Any girl i cheated on,Sheets is skeeted on
Couldnt keep it at home
Thought i needed a Nia Long
Im trying to right my wrongs

Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?,Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through these St. Laurent glasses
And Ive realized that Ive arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
These writers dont rhyme, so sort of
I thank em
That mean I forgot better @#%$ than u ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin bout glasses, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort, or even a 4 track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself thats important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is minivan

30 minutes later seems theres no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
The international awards? nah
Who complains about when he is old?
And throw a tantrum like hes 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks
from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change, or the game,
or the fame, when he came, in the game, he made his own name
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family and a deacon, folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks aint from Motown
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass, ya need to go down
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water
wash over my season
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic,You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic,After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new @#%$ sound like the best of
A&R;'s lookin like pssh we messed up
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the day I give the game back
You know the next question dog Yo, where Dame at?
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
Whats up with you and Jay, man, are yall ok man?
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands,Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe

Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged

Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice

And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break,They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she asleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just ""One Thing""
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
Cause with my family we know where home is
And so instead of sending flowers, we're the roses,I smile, when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break,(Sung) Oh, Rosie brings the sunshine, oh,I smile, when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break,I, smile, when Rosie come to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
Oh Rosie brings the sunshine (say),Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break
Mm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Oh oh oh oh no no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh-uh
I won't wait, no"

You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie,My homie Marley used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin, 16 he was stuntin
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lotta flirtin involved, but dawg
Fuck all that flirtin, I'm tryna get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie,Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie,What it do? I'm posted up in the parkin lot, my trunk wavin
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me toduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin', you see them screens fallin
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin
I'm leanin on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin somethin candy coated, crawlin like a caterpillar
I'm tippin on them four's, I'm jammin on that Screw
I'm lookin for them hoes baby what it do, drive slow homie,Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (Drive slow homie)
If you ridin around the city with nowhere to go (Drive slow homie)
Live today cause tomorrow man, you never know,Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie,My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live,And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby it's evident
You see a player flickin, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, ""Just a Lil' Bit"" (just a lil' bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin, through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie drive slow,Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie"

And there's rich nigga racism
That's that ""Come here, please buy more""

All you blacks want all the same things
Used to only be niggas now everybody play me

And I'll be alright
So hurt me as much as you like
I need you to let go
Forgot these mementos
But I'll be alright, girl,Baby, it hit so hard, holding onto my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regrets
'Cause Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget,You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget"

Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye

And I had enough,No, I don't wanna know

When you're drunk and all alone?

The polaroids and the memories

Behind the worst of us,Who's gonna walk you

We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th Birthday
We got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor,And climb to the roof
Talk about our future
Like we had a clue
Never planned that one day
I'd be losing you,In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay,So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other We made a pact,Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on (whoa),Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the Blues
It's time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse,In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, the one, the one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine (No)
Can't replace you with a million rings (No)
I should told you what you meant to me (Whoa)
Cause now i pay the price
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world

Is all I will know,Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes,You're like an Indian summer
In the middle of winter
Like a hard candy
With a surprise center
How do I get better
Once I've had the best
You said there's
Tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test,He kissed my lips
I taste your mouth
He pulled me in
I was disgusted with myself,Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you

And yes I do regret
How I could let myself
Let you go
Now the lesson's learned
I touched it I was burned
Oh I think you should know,Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes,Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh won't you walk through
And bust in the door
And take me away
Oh no more mistakes
Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay"

Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo
Oh oh,You could travel the world,
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oooh,California girls, we're unforgettable (California)
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle (uh)
Oooh oh oooh,California girls (California), we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast), now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh,Tone, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most,I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (ah),The girl's a freak
She drives a Jeep
In Laguna Beach,I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love LA,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summer time is everything,Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, tankinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie
Katy my lady (yeah)
You looking here baby (uh huh)
I'm all up on you
Cause you representin' California (oh yeah),California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh (c'mon, c'mon),California girls, we're undeniable

Oooh oh oooh (Ey, ey),(California, California girls)
California girls, man

I really wish you all could be California girls"

Maybe you had better, better luck in the sack
No formal education, I swore way too much
I swear you didn't care 'cause we were in love,So as I write this letter and shed my last tear
Know it's all for the better that we end this here
Let's close this chapter, say one last prayer

We were living on a phone line

There is no more mourning oh I

We kiss, we make up,You, you don't really wanna stay, no
You, but you don't really wanna go-o,You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down,Someone call the doctor, got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster, can't get off this ride,You change your mind like a girl changes clothes,'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down,You're wrong when it's right

Pink flamingos in the pool,I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise?,Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur but I'm pretty sure
It ruled, damn,Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot,Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard,Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois,Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna sto-op, whoa,But this Friday night do it all again
But this Friday night do it all again,Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor,Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail,Pictures of last night ended up online

There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise?,Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked-out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn,Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot,Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard,Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trios,Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op

Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again,Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail,Pictures of last night

This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science (science), we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees,And even when seasons change, our love still stays the same
You give me that hummingbird heartbeat,You spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat

I've flown a million miles just to find the magic seed
Oh, white flower with the power to bring life to me,You're so exotic, my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky-sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You give me life and keep me comin' back,I see the sunrise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies,You love me, you love me, never love me not

I took it as a warning
I should have seen it coming,So now I'll take a chance on

Intentional or not I

That as for our commitment

So take the long shot,What a pleasant surprise
What a breath of fresh air
You knock the wind out of me
Blindsided and so unaware
Aha, aha, aha,Oh, I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming

Growing fast into a bolt of lightning

I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey
Sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You don't even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans
Cause they are more distressed
So they say you've got OCD
And they claim you can barely read
But you say don't bother me with all of your reality,But it could be so simple
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed,That it's as simple as it seems,So what, you're a genius
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park in a loading zone
You sleep with the lights all on,You cross your i's and dot your t's
All it goes to show,That it could be so simple
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just that simple
(don't know what you were thinking)
The point's been missed,We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems,I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to reevaluate
The possibilities
The situations,The opportunities
That are waiting
Oh, the possibilities
Oh, I,It could, it could be that simple
(you were thinking)
Life should be that simple
(Who would have thought it)
I wish it were just so simple,(don't know what you were thinking)
You're in a haze
It's just a phase
You know this maze
Is as simple as it seems
We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh, is that I need you listen please
And focus on life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems
It is all so simple
Just deal with it"

Rubbed by your goodbyes

Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys,So over the summer something changed
I started reading seventeen, and
Shaving my legs
And I study Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school, and
Caught you staring at me,Cause I know
What you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay
Maybe one day
But not until you give me my diamond ring,Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
Your homecoming queen
Pin-up poster dream
And not one of the boys,I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna
Make out, make out, make out with me,Don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be...,Cause I don't wanna be

When you keep it all on mute
How will I know the right way to love you,Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down the man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you,I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knockin' on wood
Hopin' there's a real boy inside,'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel
That my love is real
But you're not a man,I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull astring for you
To say anything,But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart,I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again,'Cause you're not a man

That my love is real
But you're not a man,You're just a, a toy
Could you ever be
A real, real boy
And understand
But you're not a man,If the past is the problem,
Our future could solve 'em, baby.
I could bring you to life,
If you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt, but in the end
You'll be a man,You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real,

Mi cura es tu abrazo
Tu suspiro una cancion

El que conoce cada linea de tu mano
El que te cuida y camina a tu lado,Todo cambio por ti
Todo ese amor por ti
Mi corazon te abri
Desde entonces llevo el cielo dentro de mi
Nunca jamas senti
Una alegria asi
Que bendicion hallar cada instante
En que se fue la luz
Llegaste tu,Uuuuuuh uh uh

Con tu aire yo respiro

Y te ríes y me tomas por un loco atrevido
Pues no sabes cuánto tiempo en mis sueños has vivido
Ni sospechas cuando te nombré,Yo, yo no me doy por vencido

Juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar, y esperar un suspiro,Una señal del destino

No me doy por vencido,Tengo una flor de bolsillo
Marchita de buscar a una mujer que me quiera
Y reciba su perfume hasta traer la primavera
Y me enseñe lo que no aprendí de la vida,Que brilla más cada día
Porque estoy tan sólo a un paso de ganarme la alegría
Porque el corazón levanta una tormenta enfurecida
Desde aquel momento en que te vi,Yo, yo no me doy por vencido

Juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar, y esperar un suspiro,Una señal del destino

Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan.
Solo con pensarlo, se acelera el pulso.,Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal.

Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito.
Deja que te diga cosas al oído.
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo.,Despacito.
Quiero respirarte a besos despacito.
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto.
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito.,Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo.
Que le enseñes a mi boca tus lugares favoritos.

Hasta provocar tus gritos.

Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza.

Where all my kingdom is lying in your arms
Where all my dreams and my wishes will come true
And thats where I have to keep to stay forever with you,With the power of a broken heart
And the courage of an endless love
I will fight for everything I've lost
And no matter when we'll come I won't give up,With the power of a broken heart
I won't stop until I leave behind
Every moment spent away from you
In the distance of the last goodbye,After the daylight comes to night
And I look at the moon that shines for you and me
Seems alike she tells me with her smile(her smile)
With together we are ment to be,There is a place on which far beyond the stars
Where all my kingdom is lying in your arms
Where all my dreams and my wishes will come true

Every moment spent away from you
in the distance of a last goodbye,So many shattered dreams along the way
This is a price we have to pay for cruel ambition
But I believed that we will make it through
Because our love can never die,With the power of a broken heart

El beso que no diste

Regresan disfrazadas

Todo se cura con amor...
La noche pasara
Y paso a paso aprenderas, a ser mas fuerte
Y yo ire contigo,Tantas decisiones
Jamas dudar porque el mañana es hoy
Voy nadando entre emociones...
Con un solo nombre, y una sola piel
Pero aun, tengo fe
Podemos vencer
Podemos torcer la suerte, lo se
Te le haras frente,Paso a paso
Mirando hacia adelante
Paso a paso
Todo se cura con amor...
La noche pasara
Y paso a paso aprenderas, a ser mas fuerte,Aunque se caiga el mundo
Aguanta un poco mas
Estamos juntos, hasta el final...,Paso a paso
Se cura con amor...
La noche pasara
Y paso a paso aprenderas, a ser mas fuerte
Y yo ire contigo
Paso a paso..."

How I long to see your face again
Memories of you and I, now I live another life
That no longer feels like mine,Tell me how I can go on now that you're gone
All the days seem so long
And the emptiness that my heart knows
Won't let me go,And if only you could see
What my life has come to be without you're love
I'm missing you so much
And if only I had tried
To find a way so you were still here with me
It wouldn't have to be ""if only"" tonight,I never thought I'd be the one wondering what went wrong
Wondering what I could have done
But now I'm standing all alone with nothing left to lose
I wish that I could show you,What would I do for that chance to take it all back
To try to make our love last
But there's nothing more for me to give
How can I live?,To take away my pain, to hold you once again
These arms would never let go
If only you could know
If only you could know..."

Tanto he dado que lastima
Mi vida he dejado en manos de tu vida
¿Que quieres de mi?
¿Que esperas de mi?
Si todo te di
¿Cuanto cuesta tu alegría?
Si al pie de la letra cumplo lo que pidas
Yo vivo a tus pies
Y tu no lo ves
Y sigues vacía
¿Que quieres de mi?
¿Que quieres de mi?
Ohhh..."

Different faces every night, speaking words I've never heard.
Got no judge by myself, need no alibi.
No commitments so why not, take me to the spot.,Don't even know her name,
Won't ask or play that game,
We've both been here before,
I lead her to the door,I don't care for your number or your story,
It's a one night thing.
Ten to five in the morning in the back seat I won't tell you no lies.
What we have is for now, nothing more nothing less.
I'm tasting your lips as we undress.
I don't care for your number or your story,
It's a one night thing.
You left your doubts in the lobby and the dress you wore on the elevator floor.
All alone it's day, you broke the spell and went away.
But I'll never regret, our one night thing.
Not too late, 12 o' clock
When I hit the scene,
The club is packed the ladies hot
Players doing their routine
I didn't know I was being watched,
Turned around to see,
Burning eyes, target locked
As she walked right up to me,Girl say one night thing, let me hear you sing,
If you had a one night, one night thing
Guys say one night thing, let me hear you sing,
If you had a one night, one night thing."

Nothing compares to you *repeat 2x more at end of song*,It's been so lonely without you here
like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling

I went to the doctor and guess what he told me,

Cuando tú no estás llueve por dentro.,¿Qué puedo hacer?
Si tu mirada
se clava en mí.
Luego me arranca el alma.
No hay adiós.
Solo hay entre tú y yo una distancia
Que nos separa.
Quiero reír
como lo hicimos esa madrugada.
Y poco a poco rescatar el Sol de tus mañanas,
el viento entre tus alas.,Hoy llueve por dentro
en mí, en mí.
Atravieso el cielo por ti.
Se inunda el corazón mientras te pienso.
Cuando tú no estás llueve por dentro.,No es imposible amarte lejos,
de lejos.
Pero siento que muero
si no te tengo.,Hoy llueve por dentro.
Atravieso el cielo por ti.
Se inunda el corazón mientras te pienso.
Cuando tu no estás llueve por dentro."

mas yo no soy superman
no pidas más cosas ridículas
se me hace dificil volar
Pero al menos, mis besos son de verdad,Algo informal, pero romántico
no fallo a una cita jamás
siempre puntual como un maniatico
no pierdas tu tiempo
tras un superheroe ya tienes uno real,Déjame ser yo, nadie más que yo
no quieras cambiar a quien te enamoró
déjame vivir, que no soy tan malo
ni tan loco ni tan tuyo... Déjame ser yo.,Te pones más melodramática
y buscas donde no hay
ya me aburrió la misma música
tu coro de quejas a todo volumen
me quita la inspiración
Déjame ser yo, nadie más que yo, no quieras cambiar a quien te enamoró
Déjame vivir, que no soy tan malo ni tan loco ni tan tuyo... Déjame ser yo,cuarenta errores pero algo bueno, te quiero
si es lo mejor que puedo dar
no lo intentes cambiar,Déjame ser yo, nadie más que yo
no quieras cambiar a quien te enamoró
dejame vivir, que no soy tan malo
ni tan loco ni tan tuyo...,Déjame ser yo, nadie más que yo
no quieras cambiar a quien te enamoró
déjame vivir, que no soy tan ciego, ni tan sordo, ni tan mudo
... Déjame ser yo... Déjame ser yo nadie más que yo, no quieras cambiar a quien te enamoró, déjame vivir, que no soy tan malo ni tan loco ni tan tuyo

When their voices were soft.
And their words inviting.
There was a time when love was blind.
And the world was a song.
And the song was exciting.
There was a time...
Then it all went wrong.,I dreamed a dream in time gone by,
When hope was high
And life worth living.
I dreamed that love would never die.
I dreamed that God would be forgiving.
Then I was young and unafraid,
And dreams were made and used and wasted.
There was no ransom to be paid,
No song unsung, no wine untasted.,But the tigers come at night,
With their voices soft as thunder,
As they tear your hope apart,
As they turn your dream to shame!,He slept a summer by my side.
He filled my days with endless wonder,
He took my childhood in his stride,
But he was gone when autumn came.,And still I dream he'll come to me,
That we will live the years together,
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather.,I had a dream my life would be...
So different from this hell I'm living.
So different now from what it seemed,
Now...
Life...
Has killed
The dream...
I dreamed."

Can people really fall in love so fast?

Have you been too much on your own?
So many things unclear,
So many things unknown.,In my life
There are so many questions and answers
That somehow seem wrong
In my life
There are times when I catch in the silence
The sigh of a faraway song
And it sings
Of a world that I long to see
Out of reach,
Just a whisper away

Do I know if he's real?
Did he see what I saw
Does he feel what I feel?,In my life I'm no longer alone

There's so little I know
That I'm longing to know
Of the child that I was
In a time long ago
There's so little you say
Of the life you have known, why you keep to yourself, why we're always alone.
So dark, so dark and deep,
The secrets that you keep.,In my life I have all that I want,
You are loving and gentle and good,
But Papa, dear Papa in your eyes
I am just like a child who is lost in a wood!,Valjean:
No more words!
No more words,
It's a time that is dead.

That are better unheard, that are unshared!,Cosette:

I'm no longer a child
And I yearn for the truth that you know
Of the years years ago,Valjean:
You will learn
Truth is given by God
To us all in our time
In our turn,Marius:
In my life she has burst like the music of angels
The light of the sun
And my life seems to stop
As if something is over
And something has scarcely begun
Eponine,
you're the friend who has brought me here
Thanks to you I am one with the gods
And Heaven is near
And I soar through world that is new that is free!,Eponine:
Every word that he says is a dagger in me!
In my life
There's been no one like him anywhere
Anywhere, where he is...
If he asked... I'd be his,Marius & Eponine:
In my life
There is someone who touches my life,Marius:

That I'm talking to myself and not to him,And although I know that he is blind

And meet the best innkeeper in town
As for the rest, all of 'em crooks:
Rooking their guests and crooking the books
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be,Master of the house, doling out the charm
Ready with a handshake and an open palm
Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur
Glad to do a friend a favor
Doesn't cost me to be nice
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little price!,Master of the house, keeper of the zoo
Ready to relieve 'em of a sou or two
Watering the wine, making up the weight
Pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend
I do whatever pleases
Jesus! Won't I bleed 'em in the end!,Thenardier & Drinkers:
Master of the house, quick to catch yer eye
Never wants a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate!
Everybody's boon companion
Everybody's chaperone,Thenardier
But lock up your valises
Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone!,Enter Monsieur, lay down your load
Unlace your boots, rest from the road
This weighs a ton, travel's a curse
But here we strive to lighten your purse
Here the goose is cooked
Here the fat is fried
And nothing's overlooked
Till I'm satisfied,Food beyond compare. Food beyond belief
Mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef
Kidney of a horse, liver of a cat
Filling up the sausages with this and that
Residents are more than welcome
Bridal suite is occupied
Reasonable charges
Plus some little extras on the side!,Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice
Two percent for looking in the mirror twice
Here a little slice, there a little cut
Three percent for sleeping with the window shut
When it comes to fixing prices
There are a lot of tricks he knows
How it all increases, all them bits and pieces
Jesus! It's amazing how it grows!,Thenardier & Master of the house, quick to catch yer eye
Never wants a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate!
Everybody's boon companion
Gives 'em everything he's got,Dirty bunch of geezers
Jesus! What a sorry little lot!,Mme. Thenardier:
I used to dream that I would meet a prince
But God Almighty, have you seen what's happened since?,Master of the house? Isn't worth me spit!
`Comforter, philosopher' and lifelong shit!
Cunning little brain, regular Voltaire
Thinks he's quite a lover but there's not much there
What a cruel trick of nature landed me with such a louse
God knows how I've lasted living with this bastard in the house!,Thenardier & Drinkers:
Master of the house!,Mme. Thenardier:
Master and a half!,Thenardier & Drinkers:
Comforter, philosopher,Mme. Thenardier:
Ah, don't make me laugh!,Thenardier & Drinkers:

And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
It's a struggle, it's a war
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
One more day standing about, what is it for?
One day less to be living.,At the end of the day you're another day colder
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill
And the righteous hurry past
They don't hear the little ones crying
And the plague is coming on fast, ready to kill
One day nearer to dying!,At the end of the day there's another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm that'll break any second
There's a hunger in the land
There's a reckoning still to be reckoned and
There's gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day!,At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing
Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread,There are children back at home
And the children have got to be fed
And you're lucky to be in a job
And in a bed!
And we're counting our blessings!,Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today?
With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?
It's because little Fantine won't give him his way
Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands!
And the boss, he never knows
That the foreman is always in heat
If Fantine doesn't look out
Watch how she goes
She'll be out on the street!,At the end of the day it's another day over
With enough in your pocket to last for a week
Pay the landlord, pay the shop
Keep on grafting as long as you're able
Keep on grafting till you drop
Or it's back to the crumbs off the table
You've got to pay your way
At the end of the day!,And what have we here, little innocent sister?
Come on Fantine, let's have all the news!
Dear Fantine you must send us more money
Your child needs a doctor
There's no time to lose,What is this shouting all about
Will someone tear these two apart
This is a factory, not a circus!
Now, come on ladies, settle down
I run a business of repute
I am the Mayor of this town
I look to you to sort it out
and be as patient as you can
Now someone say how this began,at the end of the day she's the one who began it
there's a kid that shes hiding in some little town
there is a man she has to pay
you can guess how she picks up the extra
you cancan bet she's earning her keep sleeping around
and the boss wouldn't like it,it is true,I might have known the bitch could bite
I might have known the cat had claws
I might have guessed your little secret
Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine
Who keeps herself so pure and clean
You'd be the cause I had no doubt
Of any trouble hereabout
You play a virgin in the light
But need no urgin' in the night.,She's been laughing at you
While she's having her men
She'll be nothing but trouble again and again
You must sack her today
Sack the girl today!,Right my girl. On your way!"

See in this some higher plan
You must use this precious silver
To become an honest man,By the witness of the martyers
By the Passion and the Blood
God has raised you out of darkness
I have bought your soul for God!"

Ain't it a laugh?
Ain't it a treat?

Among the elite?
Here comes a prince
There goes a Jew.

But what can you do?
Paris at my feet
Paris in the dust
And here I'm breaking bread
With the upper crust!
Beggar at the feast!
Master of the dance!

Doing what is decent
But they're mostly broke!

Praying for the gifts He'll send.,M. and Mme. Thenardier

We're the ones who make it in the end!

Watch 'em till they drop
Keep your wits about you
And you stand on top!
Masters of the land
Always get our share
Clear away the barricades
And we're still there!
We know where the wind is blowing
Money is the stuff we smell
And when we're rich as Croesus
Jesus! Won't we see you all in hell!,(Valjean is alone in the shadows, with a bare wooden cross for company.),Valjean
Alone I wait in the shadows
I count the hours till I can sleep
I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by
It made her weep to know I die.
Alone at the end of the day
Upon this wedding night I pray
Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace
And show them grace.,God on high
Hear my prayer
Take me now
To thy care

And again I lay down my life at your feet.,Cosette, your father is a saint.
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe

Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die
I'll obey
I will try

Of those who always loved you

Then gave you to my keeping.,(The other spirits appear.),Fantine
Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last behind you.

Look down on him in mercy.,Valjean
Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory.,Valjean, Fantine, & Eponine
Take my hand
And lead me to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting.
And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God!"

They ran away when they heard my cry,Valjean
Cosette, my child, what will become of you?,Cosette
Three men I saw beyond the wall
Three men in shadow moving fast,Valjean
This is a warning to us all
These are the shadows of the past
Must be Javert!
He's found my cover at last!
I've got to get Cosette away
Before they return!
We must get away from shadows
They will never let us be
Tomorrow to Calais
Then a ship across the sea!
Hurry, Cosette, prepare to leave and say no more
Tomorrow we'll away!
Hurry, Cosette, it's time to close another door
And live another day!"

Fuelly: At rue de Bac
They're straining at the leash!
Couferac: Students, workers, everyone
There's a river on the run
Like the flowing of the tide
Paris coming to our side!
Enjolras: The time is near...
So near... it's stirring the blood in their veins!
And yet beware...
Don't let the wine go to your brains!
For the army we fight is a dangerous foe
With the men and the arms that we never can match
Oh, it's easy to sit here and swat 'em like flies
But the national guard will be harder to catch.
We need a sign
To rally the people
To call them to arms
To bring them in line!

Jean Provaire: What's wrong today?
You look as if you've seen a ghost.
Grantaire: Some wine and say what's going on!
Marius: A ghost you say... a ghost maybe
She was just like a ghost to me
One minute there, and she was gone!
Grantaire: I am agog!
I am aghast!
Is Marius in love at last?
I have never heard him 'ooh' and 'aah'
You talk of battles to be won
But here he comes like Don Ju-an
It's better than an o-per-a!
Enjolras: It is time for us all
To decide who we are...
Do we fight for the right
To a night at the opera now?
Have you asked of yourselves
What's the price you might pay?
Is it simply a game
For rich young boys to play?
The color of the world
Is changing
Day by day...
Red - the blood of angry men!
Black - the dark of ages past!
Red - a world about to dawn!
Black - the night that ends at last!
Marius: Had you been there tonight
You might know how it feels
To be struck to the bone
In a moment of breathless delight!
Had you been there tonight
You might also have known
How the world may be changed
In just one burst of light!
And what was right
Seems wrong
And what was wrong
Seems right...

Marius: The color of despair!
Enjolras: Marius, you're no longer a child
I do not doubt you mean it well
But now there is a higher call
Who cares about your lonely soul
We strive toward a larger goal
Our little lives don't count at all!
Enjolras and Red - the blood of angry men!
Black - the dark of ages past!
Red - a world about to dawn!
Black - the night that ends at last!,Enjolras: Well, Courfeyrac, do we have all the guns?
Feuilly, Combeferre, our time is running short.

Do we have the guns we need?

And I'll breath 'em all to death!

Is dead!,Enjolras: Lamarque is dead.
Lamarque! His death is the hour of fate.
The people's man.
His death is the sign we await!
On his funeral day they will honor his name.
With the light of rebellion, a blaze in their eyes.
From the candles of grief we will kindle our flame!
On the tomb of Lamarque shall the barricade rise!
The time is here!
Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer
Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts
But a jubilant shout
They will come one and all
They will come when we call!"

A heart full of you... Why regret what could not be?

Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts

You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're Lebanese, you're Orient,Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause, baby, you were born this way,No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive,No matter black, white, or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave,I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way,Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, yeah,Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way,I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey,I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby

To cut through all his worn out leather,I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But, baby, I just need one good one to stay,Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons

Can't you give me what I'm needing, needing?,Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But, baby, I just need one good one

Your tender loving's more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle, baby, baby

That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey
When you give me k-kisses

And I'm in love with you,Touch me, touch me

Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out,Psychic guru catches minnows in the harbor
(Come onto mama, come onto mama)
Everyone tells him he should work a little harder
(Hey, man, get to work, catch 'em),They all tell you that freedom must be bought
But, baby, he's already caught 'em
So, why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in,Come to mama
Tell me who hurt ya
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out,Oh, come tomorrow
Who are you gonna follow?
There's gonna be no future
If we don't figure this out,Come to mama, come onto me
Whoa, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Come onto mama, come onto mama
Come onto mama,'Cause I wanna be there
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be there,Why do we gotta tell each other how to live?
The only prisons that exist are ones we put each other in
Why do we gotta tell each other how to live?

Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everythin goes wrong, you see some bad,But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood,OH, Misunderstood, ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me, so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow
Please slow down hurricane,The wind blow, my dreads swang
He had hair like wool, like Wayne
Droppin ashes in the Bible
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle,Scary, Hail Mary no tale fairy
All real very, extraordinary

My God is my judge, no gown, no gavel,I'm a rebel, down to battle

So for those who understand, meet Dwayne
For 8 and a half months I gave Ms. Cita the pain
Now, it's Young Money, baby, keep the change,My mama say fuck em and we the same
So, hello mothafucka, you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change
Like Easter Sunday, you know church fit then outfit,Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rins but that ain't about this, what you bout bitch?
Excuse my French emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion,What are you askin?
If I don't have the answer its probably on the web
Like I'm a damn Tarantula but I know you don't understand
Cause you thought Lil Wayne is Weezy, but Weezy is Dwayne,I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood,I was watchin T.V. the other day, right
Got this white guy up there talkin about black guys
Talkin about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? America,You see 1 in every 100 Americans are locked up
1 in every 9 black Americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was tryin to stress was that
The money we spend on sendin a mothafucka to jail,A young mothafucka to jail
Would be less to send his or her young ass to college
See, and another thin the white guy was stressin
Was that our jails are populated with drug dealers,You know crack cocaine, stuff like that
Meanin due to the laws we have
On crack cocaine and regular cocaine
Police are only, I don't want to say only, right,But shit, only logic by ridin around
In the hood all day and not in the suburbs
Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And you know the other thin is mostly found in
You know where I'm goin,But why brin a mothafucka to jail
If it's not gon stand up in court
Cause this drug aint that drug
You know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that,I guess it's all a misunderstandin, I sit back and think
You know us young mothafuckas, you know that 1 in 9
We probably only sellin the crack cocaine
Because we in the hood,And it's not like in the suburb
We don't have what you have, why?
I really don't wanna know the answer
I guess we just misunderstood huh?,You know we don't have room in the jail now
For the real mothafuckas, the real criminals
Sex offenders, rapists serial killers
Don't get scared, don't get scared,I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood"

I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her

She said I'm caged in, I think her conscious is
She watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN,But when that show end, she all on my skin
Lotion, slow motion, roller coasting like back forth, hold it
She pose like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me, she said, ""Don't you ever show this"",I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless, when I spoke this, she rejoiced it
Said your words get me open, so I closed it
Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment,Uh, she ain't got a man but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, I mean flawless, well, that's what you are

Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder,Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well

And I keep a killer hoe, she gon' blow right through ya

Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side

A lil' louder
Yeah,You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love,You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love,When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder,See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love,See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love,For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love,Ooohh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook,You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love,See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love,Ooohh, see I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeahh
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual,You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain,I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain,I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure,Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society, all this pressure give me anxiety,Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulder,I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain,I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain,I been at it with my homies
it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rolling with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my squad,We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion,I know I been busting, no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up,I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain,I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain,I'm devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal
Naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear sh! t but tomorrow,And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fvcking complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fvck with Lil Wayne
I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train,Cause I'm a sucker for pain
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it,No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age,No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses,I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain,More pain
got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
for more pain
got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
for more pain
got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging

You keep the sunshine, save me the rain

I work and forever try, but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on motherfucker
'Cause all this bullshit, it made me strong motherfucker,So I pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah!,Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head

Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth
Motherfucker I'm gone,Motherfucker I'm gone
Uhhhh!,I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven sent, and you're hell proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Uhhh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak and that's a word from the wise,Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push comes to shove I just stand up and scream 'Fuck 'em all! '
Man it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, but it's time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
my book of rhymes-got em cookin' boy
crooked mind of mine-got them all sAnd-scared to look in my-eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time
And I-came up from behind and- pretty much snuck up
And butt fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'm a fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently bitch, it's beddy bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal, I'm unstoppable
Incredible hulk you're trapped in my medicine bowl,I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin head'll spin, dawg
I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives
I'll fuckin'
Pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah!,Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head

Take the brain off the whip now it don't make no sense
Stunt hard on these bitches I ain't promise tomorrow

Flute rolling killing plants, the Lil Tune shop of horror
And we roll them bitches thick, make them look like Tocarra
Man I'm to much for these nigga's and three much for these hoes
The world is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed
I love my baby mama's, they get my highest honor
Got to take care of them kids, man I know you heard Obama
And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard
I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard
Quarter back shot gun, you don't get any sack yards
Bitch I ball hard, breaking all the back boards
Pretty boy Floyd, step up I will crack yours
And even at the white house we pull up at the back doors
Walk around like I'm thirty feet tall
Tiger Wood's all these hoes trying' birdie these balls
And the Porches 911 like emergency cars
Man I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawl
Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls
Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbing two logs
Young Mula, we the new shit and new drawers
Uh, now get off my dick, I ain't fucking witcha
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Red bones do me good then her friend, her sister
I mean her bitch, she never met her best friend's sister
I leave her pussy Micro-soft like Windows Vista
Young Tuneche, pop that cucci for a goon hold
Bullet in you boys memory, now you act like you don't know
East side who I do it for, Eagle Street right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But heaven or hell I hopin' that they will be where I'mma go
Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show
Still long hair, don't care like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit go in your ass and search
I smash this verse, then I swag and surf
No Ceilings!

I put my shades on.,I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ughh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but f-ckin nevermind
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home
Yeah and I'm a blunt blowin',Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely motherf-ck ass nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga
I'ma blunt blowin',Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely motherf-ck ass nigga
With my money blowing, don't matter I got more and
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga
Stunna, I got em, I'm back on them bitches,All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but f-ck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at em
I'm a bad motherf-cker, cuz the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, Hummingbird don't hum
Big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherf-ckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
East side, My Piru Damu

I'ma blunt blowin',Polo draws showin'
I-I don't give a lovely motherf-ck ass nigga
With my money blowing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga
Okay, light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher,Y'all dead meat, and me im just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they f-cking took her
You can look into the future, its right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cuz shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherf-cker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me ocean drive slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young moola, skinnies and some supras
Belly of the beast till it pukes
Motherf-cker

I heard you were lookin' for me,
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him)
Tell me where have you been? (Around the world now I'm back again)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Who been asking bout me?)
They've been wondering why (In case you wondering)

I heard somebody say ""Church,"" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than ""Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice""
I got the flow, I'm trying to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof
So I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do? But I'ma leave it to
God, not Beaver, neither you
'Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O and even U
Man I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hating on me cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason,

While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: ""Wayne quit!""
'Cause Wayne win and they lose
I call them April babies, 'cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up
Feet up, like a parapleguc
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Su-Woo and ""Da-da-do""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there

Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy to Murcielago
Far from being the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!,
It's my go, yeah...
And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status-quo
Flow, so, pro
I know, I ride slow and when I pass
They say, ""What up, Killa?"" Man, stop bringing up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie or Jay Z
Don't forget Weezy, baby,
Hey Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me where have you been? (Yeah)

They've been wondering why? (Haha)

Tell me where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why?,
And I swear to everything, when I leave this earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Ahh, we'll lose two lives: yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, dripping tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve"

Young Money, Cash Money,
This is, the Drought 3
Ladies and gentlemens, Ya'll know me,
You know I ride for my motherfunkin' niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
They tell me dont get high, and I should try to make a living,
I tell em' imma hustler and I'd rather make killin'
My eyes is so wide as he watchin the skillet,
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it, imma kill her,
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas,
And fuck ya, hospital, young money, we the illest,
And I aint gotta lie when I tell you im the illest,
My flow is nasty, like C Y Phyllis,
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business.
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist,
And when I was 5, my favorite movie was the Gremlins
Aint got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention,
You looking for devine and the little intervention,
And them birds don't fly, without my permission,
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes,
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons,
See my world is different,
Like Dwayne Wayne,
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thang,
And you know that imma ride with my motherfuckin niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Cuz the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And if you look high, you see that im gonna be in it
The sky is the limit,
Buck Ten in the coupe, And your bitch love it,
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects,
Tell a bitch don't talk to me,
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free,
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap,
Cuz im the type that let money talk for me,
My flow is art, unique,
My flow can part a sea,
The only thing on a mind of a shark, is eat,
By any means, and you're just sardine,
I got the 40 cal. Tucked in my p.r.ps.,
What do you expect, I'm from New Orleans,
And majority of my city is rowders,
They tried to make a brand new map without us,
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars,
And no matter how you change it, it will still be ours,
And imma ride with my motherfuckin niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And imma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
Because the sky is the limit,
Yeah, the sky is the limit,
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,
Cuz the sky is the limit,
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,
Use your head, or I'll take it off ya shoulder,
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting on the livingroom sofa,
(that's fucked up, haha)
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,
Use your head, or ill take it off ya shoulder,
Mail it to your mom, put a dozen of roses, (Now that's fucked up)
And I'm a G,
And you aint gotta know the alphabet to see,
I know that my whole city is depending on me,
And I forget a lot of shit, but I could never forget the streets,
So you know that im gonna ride with my motherfuckin niggas,
Most likely imma die with my finger on the trigga,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till i get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
Don't worry bout mine, imma grind till i get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
Because the sky is the limit,
Yeah, the sky is the limit,
And If you look high, you'll see that im gonna be in it,
Cuz the sky is the limit,
They tell me dont get high, and I should try to make a living,
I tell em' imma hustler and I'd rather make killin'
Cuz the sky is the limit,
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit,

Haters can't see me, but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say choose wisely, that's why I was chosen
Rocking like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!,Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me ""baby, it's real""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
But she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Yeah,,Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will,(Ladies and gentlemen, Drizzy...),Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and told me ""baby, it's real""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I'm get to it)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
But she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Carter 4 Tunchi Yeah,Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now

She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they want to talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night i have a dream that i am smashin' them all
Young Money man, this shit so timeless
And im in the mood to get faded so please bring your finest
And what are all your names again, we drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like i am, let's be honest
She wants me, she wants me
Cuz i got it all shawty, tell me what you don't see
I would fuck with all y'all, all of y'all are beautiful
I just can't pick one so you can never say im choosey, hoes

She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider,Chorus

I ain't bein' disrespectful, baby im just bein' Millz
And i dont know how fake feels so i gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every house of diddy chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Will so married woman and MILF
It dont matter who you is, miss you-can-get-the-business, hah,Verse 4
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas

For free suites, i'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus

Kit-kat a midget, if that ass soft, i break her off
I exchange v-cards with the retards
And get behind the christian like d.r.

Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, 'Be quiet, we need our privacy'
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably,Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory,Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tie is Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless

Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You don't want to start with Weezy, 'cause the 'F' is for finisher,So misunderstood, but what's the world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when ya twist her
Never met the bitch, but I'll fuck her like I missed her,Life is a bitch and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
You know father time and we all know mother nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation,No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just huntin' nut
Young Money runnin' shit and you niggas just runner-up's,I don't feel I've done enough so I'mma keep on doin' this shit
La Tucci or Young Tunafish,Yeah, I'm goin' back in,I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But ho's gon' be ho's so I couldn't blame Tammy,Just talk to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self-defense
Swimmin', I be seein' through this niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-man, pow, pow, the end,Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let you ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt,Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on dead bolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke,Glass half-empty, half-full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'mma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy them while they still ripe,Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these nigga's animals then I'mma have a mink suit
Tell them bitches I said put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all,And I call it like I see it and my glasses on
But most y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money,Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sort of, kinda
Woman of my dreams? I don't sleep so I can't find her,You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swagg' you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on body-builder,Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell,Word to my mama, I'm out of my Lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend,I played the side for you niggas that's tryin' to front and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I blow like Buddha
Disturb me and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda,Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bald like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter,Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause,To feed them on my grind, did I get a little love? Keep throwing my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side 'cause ain't no peace on my side,Bitch, I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune tells me who I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a B.X. nigga, ya heard? Gunna
Gunna, gunna"

Mack, I'm going in,A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual, bleed
Through the pencil, I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha

You can't man 'em then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em then you drop 'em

Like smoke in the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me

He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scaring nothin'
On some faggot bullshit; call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch?
Yeah, I ate a shy bitch, and she ain't shy no more
She changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch; so when she ask for the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
It ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass; you ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill; not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick; I'm it,Motherfucker, I'm ill,They say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that, true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say: ""Life ain't shit without me.""
Chrome lips poking out the coupe, look like it's pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain; dare me!
Don't you compare me, 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me, but they fear me; I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat"

As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand,Uh, wake up and smell the pussy

And I don't bust back because I shoot first
Uhh, how do he say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limpin' off tour cause I made more off my second leg
Motherfuckin' Birdman Junior, eleventh grade
Ball on automatic start
I could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, no-now c'mon be my blood donor,Flow so nice, you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn, where you stumbled at?
From where they make gumbo at
Kane got the fuckin' beat jumpin' like a jumping jack,And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip Hop I'm the heart of that, nigga nothin' short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat
Uhh

I'm a young money millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'ma venereal disease like a menstrual bleed,Threw the pencil and leak the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cuz I don't write shit cuz I ain't got time
Cuz my seconds, minutes, hours go to the all mighty dollar
And the all mighty power of dat chit cha cha chopper,Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father mothafucker a copper
Got da Maserati dancin' on the bridge pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, ha ha ha ha you can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em
I go by them goon rules if you can't beat 'em then you prop 'em,You cant man 'em then you mop 'em
You cant stand 'em then you drop 'em
You drop 'em cuz we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Motherfucker I'm ill,A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derrierre
Like smoke in the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini
Hopin' them crackers see me like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy"",""He's a beast he's a dog, he's a motherfuckin' problem""
Okay you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit
Call him Dennis Rodman,Call me what you want bitch
Call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private
Damn I hate a shy bitch,Don't you hate a shy bitch?
Yeah I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to my bitch
Yeah nigga, that's my bitch
So when she ask for the money when you through don't be surprised, bitch,It ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass, you ain't got shit
Motherfucker I'm ill, not sick
And I'm o.k., but my watch sick,Yeah my drop sick
Yeah my glock sick
Am I not thick?
I'm it
Motherfucker I'm ill,See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and Tupac
Andre 3000, where is Erykah Badu at?
Who that? Who that said they gon' beat Lil' Wayne
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame,Now who that wanna do that, boy you knew that chew that swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour,And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour,Don't play in her garden, and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawnmower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowery
Even Gwen Stefani say she couldn't doubt me,Motherfucker I say like face shit without me
Chrome lips pokin' out, the coupe look like it's poutin'
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I will turn a crack rock into a mountain
Dare me,Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me, but they hear me
They don't feel me, but they fear me
I'm illie, C3"

Hermes, Pastelle, I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed
That means it's permanent so I guess I should address it, huh?,My swagga is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on the track I asthma attack it
""Why ya so mad for it? Why ya gotta have it?""
'Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master,Na-na-na

Can't wear skinny jeans 'cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans 'cause my knots so thick,You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps, it's the road to success
Where the niggas lookin' feral when the girls say yes,But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
In that all-blue Yankee, it's my graduation cap,It's Hova!
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda

Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spittin' certain purpose
If you ain't living what you kickin' then you worthless,Lookin' from the surface it may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do,Ain't nobody hot as me even if they rap they ass off
Blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lotta records, I respected and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats, I'm the truth at,You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag,No one on the corner have swagga like us

Watch me choke about this dope, blueberry from Texas
You wanna get up in rotation that's too bad 'cause I'm stressin'
Right now it's 1:30 a.m., 11 Percocets just entered me

*lighter flick*
Aye,[Verse 1]
I'm a lover, not a fighter, I can't find my lighter
My house is five stories, I don't tell 'em, I don't write 'em
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright, I'mma need a sun visor
187 make your bitch run my errands
At the bar with the Dracula, ordering Bloody Marys
Got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see Hell out my window, Lord, this view is amazing
If I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands, it got all under my nails
People under the stairs, better not fuck with my feet
I be so fucking faded, who washed the colors with bleach?
Niggas biting my style, hope it gets stuck in their teeth
I been had the green light, now please don't jump in the street
Se la vi, oui oui oui, watch me french kiss the sky
Then ask, What is that smell? That's the shit on my mind
I don't like you, or niggas like you
And Nino Brown's still my motherfucking idol
Keep a brown rifle for niggas like you
Kill you in a drive-thru, then go viral
Ooh, I don't like you and niggas like you
And Nino Brown's still my idol
The Glock 17 is still a minor I'll kill you over something minor
I get at you, night Twighlight whine like a wine-o, high like a high-note
Go at your head like a rhino, leave your shit bloody red like albino
I'm a nigga with a title, care less bout' a nigga title
I'm entitled and get homicidal
Wild as El Chapo, wild as Al Qaeda
Stuntin' on my rivals upon arrival
Numbers aren't liars, I am number one
I am on one
I am on ten stuntin' on twelve
I keep it a hunnid
Oh Lord!,[Chorus]

Nigga please, nigga please
You heard em' scream help me please
Help me please, help me please
Get pleased whenever I please
Hercules, hercules,[Verse 2]
I'm twisting up the kush, Sticky Fingaz like Onyx
Throwing up gang signs, you can see em' all in my vomit
I'm sleeping with the enemy, in bulletproof pajamas
I'm cool like that, but the climate is climbing
I got issues bigger than you, I got bitches taller than me
All that ratchet and bougie, I guess I like R&B;
I'm unapologetic, I'm sorry for not being sorry
These niggas don't know I'm talking about real stories
I need benadryl for my trigger finger
Bad bitches for my homeboys
The grass is greener on the other side
I'm focused on my own yard
Focused on getting more dough
Twisting up like tonsils
Rich as fuck, but moreso a poor soul
Oh well, if snow fell like hoes fell, then I'd be a snowman
My bitch is a soldier, fuck me GI Joe-Ann
They thought I ain't had no chance
I took the dice and rolled them
I left that crap table with a chip on my shoulder
Ahhhh!,[Chorus 2]

They worship me certainly
Purple lean, purple weed
Percocet, pericyazine
Search a scene, search a dean
Search a bling, ching ching
Search the queen
Search her purse, search her clean
Search his turf, search his team
Search the sleeve, check for wings
First, I curse, then I squeeze
They say they lit? where the steam?
Let em' live, let em' breathe
Let em' live, let em' breathe?

And you don't make enough noise
No cape, no sawdust
Still go Hercules

Rest In Peace Mercy D

And that's who you bout' to meet
All ya'll versus me

And in the Lambroghini I do doughnuts like Dunkin's.
How come every bad bitch with a pussy wanna fuck em',
But I just feed em' drugs and just watch em' fuck each otha,
My neck was a hundred, and my wrist was anotha,
It make her pussy wet I leave that bitch with a puddle,
I'm a beast I'm a dog, I should rap with a muzzle,
Peyton Manning flow, I just go no huddle,
Baby girl gettin' straight dick, no cuddle,
You know I'm out this world, I just bought a space shuttle,
I'mma put some D's on that bitch!,And these hoe's starting to get like flea's on my shit,

Yellow white diamonds call it cheese on em' grits,
You nigga's ain't ballin',
Real talk, you nigga's can't guard me,
Two nigga's can't guard me,
You lookin' at Jordan,
From the side like Spike at the Garden,
I got that hardest bars, call me the warden,
Excuse me pardon, I break a bitch down like Tanya Harding,
Bitch I'm cold not dude off Martin,
Pockets just fat like the Clumps and Norbit,
Bitch I'm fly like a magic carpet,
And bitch I'm fresh like a pack of Orbit,
See I'mma take it and gon' bring it back to New Orleans,
And bitch I'mma shine in the land of darkness,

A wall is,
And I'm high, don't wanna know how deep the fall is,
No I can't come down,
And every time I send my girl outta town,
I put some D's on that bitch!,I'm a certified gangster,
Hater's make me nauseous, so money make me anxious,
Listen how my words are poetic like Langston,
Dreads down my back like I come straight from Kingston,
But I come from Hollygrove, 17 danger zone,,So many c note's I could sing a song,
T-top coupe, lookin' like a thong,
Your girl love my dick, she treats it like a bong,
I don't want be right if gettin high is wrong,
My eyes so low I look like I'm from Hong Kong,
Boy I got more green than a bitch of Don Juan,,Haha,Ok, I'm not a rookie I'm a pro; Methazine fiend,
Make the homies say Hoe, and make all the girlies scream,
I am a vegetarian man I only eat beats,
Wear a lot of carrots and I smoke the best green,
No beef, in my grocery bag,
Just some Swisher's and a whole bunch of cans of Whoop Ass,
I'm strapped like a bookbag,
So any one of ya'll can come on and get a foot tagged,
Eat all day,
Ride all night,
Sleep no way,
Sleep when I lay,
Six feet deep,
And until that day,
I'mma be livin' like it is that day.,I keep holdin' on,
I said bitch I been hot,
Bitch the stove been on,
If you don't like it I roll over and roll alone,
Fuck you and the horse that you rode in on,
Some cool shorts in my Corvezone,
Lookin' slicker than the lane that you bowlin' on,
If they ain't tell you I'm the shit, then they told ya wrong,
Bitch I'm bubblin' like soda foam,

Rip yo ass apart than I put myself together

The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gonna bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini 'til I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papi gave me 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny momma, only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm Santa Claus
Niggas gather round, got gifts for all of y'all
Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up
It's a cold world I need a bird to cuddle up

I'm living that lifestyle, I'm livin' that lifestyle
That money I need it right now, I need it right now,I need my money,Can't drop a mention about the opposition, forty flicker like a camera vision,Dead bodies pitching, picture nothing better than the feeling
Need cash fast, smoking dope gas mask, since a kid with the cig with my bad ass
Broke bitches see it ain't my biz, but a nigga is the pigs with his fat ass
I'd take a slug for mine, lifestyle to live cause I love to grind,Judge gave his ass a double trial

You trusting that bitch she won't' hold you down
Smoking on loud, that's surround sound
There's a knock at the door I look at the peep hole
I leave you with stiches so where is Lilo?
Pay me my money before it get repoed
All the dirt that I did, And the lord he still chose,Nigga I'll a tweak 'bout my money
Up at night, no sleep 'bout my money
Get your ass killed in a week 'bout my money
I'm off a pill and I'm geeked 'bout my money
I'm living that lifestyle, livin' that lifestyle
I'mma need it right now, right now
I'm living that lifestyle, I'm livin' that lifestyle
That money I need it right now, I need it right now
I need my money"

Hah-aha, leggo,Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missing
Yeah, yeah
That shit look like a toupee
I get what you get in 10 years, in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr.Miyagi
And them suicide doors, Hari Kari,Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker,Lil nigga bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killing every nigga that come try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops I said on my dick
I ain't really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done,Hell, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When you're doing that thing over there homie
Ay ay ay ay ay ay
Let's go!
'Cause I'm feeling like I'm running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday, day
Go!
See they really really wanna pop me
Blow!
Just know that you will never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky
Oh
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come a nigga gotta set it, then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta shut out any little thing that nigga think that he be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna dadadada
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do a lot of things, to make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again, and again, and then again And I be doing it to death and now I move a little foul
A nigga better call a ref, and everybody knows my style
And niggas know that I'm the best when it come to doing this
And I be banging on my chest, and I bang in the east, and I'm banging in the west
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? Let's go
See the way we on it and we all up in the race and you know
We gotta go, now try to keep up with the pace
And we struggle and I hustle and I set it and I get it
And we always gotta do it take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it, have it,Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker,Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the 3 stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my Jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with an elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said, ""Shoot 'em,"" and I said, ""OK""
If you want that bullshit then I'm like ""Olé""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch I'm outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain't hotter than mine, nope, not on my time and I'm not even trying
What's poppin' Slime? Nothin' five, and if they trippin' fuck 'em five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight,
Bitch I've been tight since ""Guiding light"",
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my mamma's nice and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild, been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
I'm so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now, bitch,Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper

'Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on it, on
I'm racing on, if my heart races on,Uh, I'm priceless, remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me and continue to bite me
Got no degree but where I'm from, that's the original climate
Where you can't tell a fiend a crack rock isn't a diamond
Hold on, Lord if my Bugatti come to a dead end
I've already been everywhere except heaven
And tomorrow's not promised, when I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my momma, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side
Where the flowers never die, the angels never lie
Yeah, the revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized
Oh, momma hate I got my daddy's eyes
Never looked into my daddy's eyes, he ain't have the time
Fuck him, the revolution will be televised

Fuck it, I'm making money before making changes
I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it then exchanged it
Fuck it, I'm working bitch, I know you see me working
Searching for better days, before a better person
I'm perfect, just ask my bitch and she'll say that's so urgent
I purchased, my children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah, my heart right and my head ain't, cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think, and I grew wings
If you catch a feather just keep it, and I'll be racing on
No short cuts, no cheating,When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)

I'm racing on, if (I'm gone)
My (There's nothing left but to fly, if you catch a feather just keep it) heart races on,This morning I woke up on my good side
Life is just a race against time so have a good time
Heart racing, thoughts racing, competition, goodbye
I turn around, run backwards to see what second place look like
Oh Lord, what are we running from?
The police cause they already killed enough of us
Stay out them streets cause they don't fuck with us, they hunting us
We in a race against racists, that's a color run
I keep my feet above the ground, we gon' run the town
Heart racing on, beat, beat, beating, knock and pound
Love marathon, getting deeper by the mile
I see no finish line, on your mark, set, pow"

Fuck the world make you walk with a leg twitch
Flow retarded
I'm on some special ed shit
The magnificent twist it like a dred bitch
And I can get up in a car and drive
And if your record is a smash I can still survive
Money ain? t a thing but every thing to me
Shit I gotta make em see no one sang to me
Higher than all of the angels be
No I never choke but I strangle beats
I am just a player in this game we be
So go blame the referee don't complain to me
And I used to have a cutless on stainless feet
Passing all day up in Latoya street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Have me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedaling my 10-speed bike
Who knew I be pedaling a 6-speed white
Big dog through the doors where the little dogs bite
So if you are a female dog you don? t fight

I told you mothafuckas before we in the house
And we standing on the couch

Bartender pour a round I took a few sips
Stumbling falling down I ain? t drunk that; s my new step
Now why would I listen to bullshit they shovel
When they taste level ain't at my waist level
I'm fly get on a plane jet lagged already
I'm tired
The dough ya'll bags is heavy
I'm fire
The flow hard as a Chevy
So I told her me likey
She said she like me
But when she see me with a CL like Py
She just wanna grab the microphone and beat box
Even in high school I was always a special kid
First pack of condoms I asked for extra big
Now I got a flow that sit me right next to BIG
And all these old rappers don't know where the exit is
But, but, but no buts nigga what nigga
You fired mothfucka Donald Trump nigga

Now I give a fuck less

Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a preemie
But I'm not and my nuts big
Don't know what the fuss is
My crib is ilustrous
My rep is impeccable
Not to be fucked with
Shit. This if this is what thats all about
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress
All I got is this big house
Couple cars I don't bring half of them shits out
All is ace of spades
I drank just to piss out
I mean I like the taste could? ve saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow tows no bull
Hld up let me move a bowel
I'll shit on ya'll niggers
O.G. tell these boys (don't shit on my nigger)
I'm way too important to be talking about extortin
Asking me for a Porsche is like asking for a coffin
In broad daylight I off your on switch
Your not too bright good night
Long kiss
Bye, bye
My reply
Blah, blah
Blast burner then past burner
Tah, tah
Finish my breakfast why
I got an appetite for destruction and you? re a small fry
I got watches I ain? t seen in months
Apartment at the trump
Only slept in once
Nigger said hova was over
Such dummies
Even if I fell I land on a bunch of money

I could see her in my life
She would've had the world if she were mine
But, see she had other plans, I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away

She tried to keep 'em entertained
When they can hardly remember her name uahh
She did everything she could
Just to make them laugh and treat her good
She'd find herself alone
Asking herself where did she go wrong-wrong-wrong

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Straight
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""Hello"" or ""Happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's f-cked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all

Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?

My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?

I'm on it, ooh, I'm on it
I'm so on it, and however you want it
You can get it tonight ho, and all night ho
I get the beat from (Maestro), fuckin' right ho,
I might go crazy on these niggas, I don't give a motherfuck
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up
What! What! I don't give a motherfuck
Getcha baby kidnapped and ya baby-mother fucked
It's tha Carter 3, bitch, better put your supper up
Hollygrove I throw it up like I'm trying to lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level? you can't get on my level
You would need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you bout to suck my dick, bitch!
Swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
2 more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor I could have died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches like Magic
Abracadabra I'm up like Viagra
I just do this shit for my clique like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'mma keep it on my channel
Watch me, bitch, watch me
Bitch watch me! But they cannot see me
Like Hitler, it's the New Orleans Nightmare
Money so old it's growing white hair
Young Money, baby, yeah we right here
I'mma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
And mama, don't cry, your son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put her in the hills
Yeah, when I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14 I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I say
I told my girl ""when you fuck me, better fuck me good
Cause if another girl could, she gonna fuck me good""
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it
Yeah, I got game like Stuart Scott
Fresh out the ESPN shop
And when SportsCenter poppin' everything stoppin'
But you can't fool me, I know what you watching
Me! You watch me, you watch me, cause I be
Weezy, must see, T.V, C3
Nigga that's me and I'm me, I'm me times 3
So retreat or suffer defeat
I'm back 3-peat, C3"

You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say...,[Lil' Wayne:]
Ok I'm talking bout a
Good girl gone bad
Crooked world wrong pad
Right mom wrong dad
I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up like some bbq from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the freshcut and they're on her like sutures
And I wanna talk to her
But her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better
She's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain
Trust me I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an oncoming train
Stuck in the passenger seat
Tryna do the fast lane,[Bun B:]
Well once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter two story house two car garage
And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard
See daddy was a doctor
And mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced
So now mommy's drinker
Daddy had a malpractice suit
Now he's a snorter
And all this shits takin place
right in front of their daughter
She says, Daddy what's wrong?
But he's just too high
Mommy what we gon' do?
She just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs trying to do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
They say,[One Republic:]
I'm holding on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearin what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me

Damn, I'm a get in the niggas chest like bunch a phlegm
Like a fucking ram, I'm a hunt for the lamb
I'm a dump 'em man, in a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier, ask Uncle Sam
Hair nappy like Kam
Nigga fuck your plan, fuck your man
You ain't a pimp unless you get the same bitch to fuck your man and fuck your clan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh, Goddamn, there's my sound, po-play likes that's my band
Gotta get it cleared
Suck my dick with red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos
And I meant every tear and I'm still on that street shit, 
back to the beat bitch,That's how you let the beat build bitch
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch
Let the beat build and say (yeah yeah yeah)

Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as god as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pocket pissin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Told tools like mechanics, mechanism
Uh, Detrimental on any instrumental

Ain't no mother fucker harder than (Carter)

Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died,Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives,When shit get deep I'm never afraid to die
Let the money pile up and tell 'em buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell,Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses
I president carter Pres (Amen) President
President Carter Pres President Carter so now
President Carter instead of pledge
we pray President Carter
Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Realitys a bitch and I'm a dance with her,140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech
Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth hahahaha
thank you thank you all

Good girl, gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path
Right Mom, wrong Dad
I sing this song mad, but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some bbq from Luther's
In the mornin' with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the freshcut and they're on her like sutures
And I wanna talk to her
But her Mama has to school her
I wanna see her better
She's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane

If you just let me explain
Trust me I know what I'm sayin'

Stuck in the passenger seat
Travlin' through the fast lane,[Bun B]
Well once upon a time, there was a Mom and a Dad
Who on the outside had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two story house, two car garage
And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard
See Daddy was a doctor
And Mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced
So now Mommy's dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit
Now he's a snorter
And all this shit's takin' place
Right in front of their daughter
She says, Daddy what's wrong?
But he's just too high
Mommy what we gon' do?
She just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin' to do right
Lookin' for answers alone in the darkness of night

I want to be the best that ever played
That's why I play the game
And to be the best you have to win
That's what drives me,He's the best player in the game
It's just that simple
There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do
He will defend your best player
He will shoot from the perimeter
He will get all in yo mug
He will do whatever it takes
He is the most complete basketball player
In the game today - bar none
He has an assassins mentality
I said this week, I said this when the trade went down
And I will repeat it again
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship
More than Kobe Bryant? There is no one,This guy is Hollywood,What separates Kobe from the pack?
More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one,OK
Kobe doin' work
Two-four on my shirt
He the greatest on the court
And I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the 4th ring like it was his first
Gotta get the bling
Do it for Kareem!
Two-four so nice, my flow so mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldestein
Kobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings
Kobe in the game dunking on your team
Black Mamba, attack conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Crossover good, a turnaround jumper
Or just drive in the lane and dunk on dunkers,You know where it's going, it's going down yo
This is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though,I call him King Bryant, now let the crown show,I'm definitely, I'm just lost for words
I mean, he's amazing,Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry 'bout my shot
'Cause I'ma get that off
Yea, I drops 40 on your double team
Then I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch I work 'em like an auction
No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
'Cause I don't take breaks
I just break records
And I prefer the ball with 3 seconds
And I bet we gon' win it all in 3 seconds
Ya dig? That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense
Don't ever man to man with me
Double team, triple team,Your defenders sick of me
But, I never let 'em get to me,Literally
Step back and give 'em a three
Ain't no defending me,One guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately
LeBron James,I've been recorded saying that
He's definitely the best player in our league
Um, to me, in my eyes
The best scorer in our league
And there's not another guy in our league
That can accomplish some of the things
That he's doing,Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the key
And get a J off
Baseline facetime
Tongue out like two-three
Even two-three gotta love how I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight outta high school
Tha brackets ain't for me
I will be jumping over you
Like I got a mattress at my feet,And all the Phil Jackson teams
Better be passing it to me
I put the master in the beast
Attack you like a beast,I am starving for victory
And that means I'ma eat
And when they ask you who's the best
Then the answer should be me,Reporter: Who's the best player in the NBA?
Mikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant.
Reporter: Really? Why?
Mikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get,Call me Mr. Clutch or Mr. Automatic
I can post 'em up, or Lamar go get the alley
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want? They want Kobe
And what he want? He want the trophy
The victory,And the glory
No Shaq
No Robert Horry
Now break 'em off, Kobe break 'em off
You better be where that Laker don't
Yea, just give him the ball and he take it off
Or he properly dishing it to Gasol
Or give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
'Cause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah,Do it for Magic
It's your time baby
I see nothing wrong with doing it four times baby
I'm the best yes
And he the best yeah
Don't worry LeBron - get 'em next year
Now what's defense
To an assassin?
Killer instinct
Murder the basket,Then steal the ball back
Hold it for ransom
It's more than a game
This is a passion
Been a all-star, been a champion
Free throw line, you hear 'em chanting
MVP, MVP
Kobe Bryant aka Envy Me
In knee deep, smash any D
Whoever he is he can't guard me

I fuck around and catapult ya
Torch ya
Thought yo parents taught ya
You guys is cho-cha
I'm a goin' buenos noches

And I don't even write
No author
So harder

Oh father, will tonight be my last?
And if so, make sure my kids see my cash
And I know, I'm solid like an elbow cast
And my future will be, better than my past
Weezy!,[Chorus]
You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm goin' wherever tha money take me
Until they funeral awake me
And don't wake me
Cause I'm sleepin'
I'm dreamin'
I know that there is a better way
Cause I've seen it lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it, say I need it,C-A-R-T-E-R I spit movies like a V-C-R
I spit rounds like a the tiqi bar
And if I got beef I am tha meet Cleaver
And I are
The illest nigga Martin Luther King
Died for and I ride for
Hollygrove, one-seven eagle street
And I'm higher than an' eagles feet
But I believe in me
Apple is the cross street
I am just an off-spring
Born in the ghetto
That's why I can't let go
One call will have my dogs on you like an echo
Baby I am the real deal no picole (uh)
Spit cical cell psycho
I go off like a mothafuckin' rifle
And I from
The underground baby like a pipe hole
I will stand tall like light poles
'til the light blows,You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm goin' wherever the money take me
Until they funeral awake me
And don't wake me
Cause I'm sleepin'
And I'm dreamin'
See I'm just hustlin'
Livin' what I belavin dog
And there's a problem
When the homies not eatin'
And I'm greedy, I'm greedy,Share my blood, feed my family,
My flow would have to plead insanity
So sick I need Greys Anatomy
Acid like a bust open battery
I'm cool like L.A. nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
A juelz I swear of tha day I pissed crystal
These bitches tryna kick it like Jun Tao
I gotta watch my head in the battle
I'm just tryna stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floatin' like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and raddle snakes
But I promise I will take a nigga off like Saturday
Got money to validate
I'm icy like carrot cake
Different color of diamonds
Make me look like a salad plate,
I'm straight out tha alley way
It's tha nigga ya Daddy hate
Weezy F Baby, great!,I know they love me or hate me
But I'm a G it won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me, yeah
Until you ridin to elate me
And don't wake me
Cause I'm sleepin'
And I'm dreamin'
And me and my Lord
Got an agreement dog
And so I thank him everyday for my achievements

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do (that's all I can do mama)
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart (I hope you hear me),(Lil Wayne)
Poong since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
be prayin' for the day you come back to me, sayin' that you forgive me
Give me another chance, I'm needin' it like a kidney
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much
but I f**ked up, I know I f**ked up, I admit I f**ked up
but everybody f**k up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tellin' me and my clique don't give a f**k
Cause um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster . BANG!,() (Lil Wayne)
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control (I see you hidin' it mama)
You got it down, and your well on your way to the top (keep doin' your thing)
but there is something you forgot,(Lil Wayne)
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
and if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star under sunlight,See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl and you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me, is what I mean to rap (what I mean to rap),() (Lil Wayne)
You've been hiding, (y'know) never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin' it mama)
to keep it under control (but I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
and your well on your way to the top
(but I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness shawty),But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin' room watchin' Sports Center
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner, but the Lord is a forgiver
You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
and your boyfriend is not like me
Mind you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me ""Butta"", I called you ""Babe""
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you
and I know you probably wish you never met me, and I just wish you never forget me
and let me say, please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
and I hope that nigga know he got a queen, and all I can do is dream . DAMN!
I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart"

(Wee ooh wee ooh wee),Like a cop car...
When I get up all in ya
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us,And when I'm in that thang, I'll make that body sang
I make it say.
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
I'll make ya say...
Mrs. Officer, Mrs. Officer
Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of ya
I'm Kidd Kidd... my face on every wanted poster,I'm wanted by every lady cop all over
That ass so big I catch a battery to hold ya
Hands so big you thought I told ya to pull it over
She pulled me over... pulled me out the Rover
Then she pulled me closer... do me in the back of the car,Put me in handcuffs start ripping my pants off
(all you heard on the dispatcher is...)
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key
Call your sergeant and tell him you can't finish your shift
Cause it's on... tonight,Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast and head
And I can't wait to get it on
Wanna do it all night long... Mrs. Officer
When I get up all in ya
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang, I'll make that body sang
I make it say...
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
I'll make ya say..."

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time,All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away,It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go,I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when,I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter,One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to remind myself how I tried so hard,In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far,Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end,You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when,I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter,I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know,I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know,I tried so hard and got so far

I had to fall to lose it all

I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I've said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead so
Picking up the pieces now where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again,All I want to do is trade this life for something new

Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go, but there's comfort in the panic,And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can't escape the gravity,I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
To so much more than I can carry,I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?,You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy,I know I'm not the center of the universe

Takes me one step closer to the edge

I followed, so taken, so conditioned I could never let go.
Then sorrow, then sickness, then the shock when you flip it on me.
So hollow, so vicious, so afraid I couldn't let myself see.
That I could never be held, back up, no, I'll hold myself.
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well, forget the rest, let them know my hell.
Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell, kept respect up the vets stay their.
Let the best be the tale they tell, that I was there saying.,And these promises broken, deep below, each word, gets lost in the echo.
So, one last lie, I can see through, this time I, finally let you, go, go, go.,Test my will, test my heart, let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up.
Y'all go hard, I go smart, how's it working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that, frustration, been crossed cross, then lost and told no.
And I've come back, unshaken, let down, I've lived and let go.
So, you can let it be known, I don't hold back, I hold my own.
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned, I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone.
I can't fall back, I came too far, hold myself up and love my scars.
Let the bells ring wherever they are, 'cause I was there saying.,And these promises broken, deep below, each word, gets lost in the echo.
So, one last lie, I can see through, this time I, finally let you, go, go, go, go!,No, you can tell 'em all now, I don't back up, I don't back down.
I don't fold up and I don't bow, I don't roll over, don't know how.
I don't care, where the enemies are, can't be stopped, all I know, go hard.
Won't forget how, I got this far and every time, saying.,And these promises broken, deep below, each word, gets lost in the echo.
So, one last lie, I can see through, this time I, finally let you.

Why am I so uptight today?

Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall

That the face inside is hearin' me

Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can
But everybody has a face that they hold inside

A face that laughs every time they fall

Falling into empty space

Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant

Painted on my memories

Keeping everything inside

You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

When things go wrong
I pretend the past isn't real

We're building it up
To burn it down

To burn it to the ground,The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds

And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring,You lost that right to hold that crown

So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn,And you were there at the turn

One more time get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now here we go!(Can I get an encore?

Cliff hanger, its another club banger.
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat.
Get on down!
Times up, games over you lose I win
'bout to show this knuckleheads how to do this
here.,Ooh yeah, new year next phase begin.,Look who's got you goin' crazy again.
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in.,I go out and just come back full circle again.
You're a fad.
That means you're something we already had.,But once you're gone, yeah,Dont come back.
Too bad, You're off the map now, radar can't
even find you.
You stay on the grind, you slip.
We out grind you.
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind
you.
We walk around, just playing the violin behind
you(We walk around just playing the violin
behind you)
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin'
and bitchin'(Enough with all the pissin' and
moanin', whinin' and bitchin')
Sit and observe, listen.
You'll learn if you'll pay attention.
Why ten multi platinum albums later, three,diamond.,Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and
still climbin'(Worldwide, we're on the charts with
a bullet and still climbin')
Can I get an encore?
Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with a Brooklyn boy.
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
uh-uh-woo.
What the hell are you waiting for?
After me there should be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise
So all my people on the left, all my people on
the right
Scream one last time.
When Dr. Dre says crunk,
You'll get it crunk. (Get it crunk)
Crunk, crunk, crunk.
And when 50 cent says jump,
You get on one foot and (Jump!!)
Jump Jump Jump!!
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to
sense it.
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that-
Doc is off the benches.
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges.
We ain't showin' off,
We just goin' off on popular consensus.
But critics say, Doc is soft, Doc is talk,
Doc is all washed up, knock it off.
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong
impression.
You must be on the cock of Doc,
Cause Doc left you all guessin'.
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the
record(What??)
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a
second.(Bom, bom)
That's why we always save the best cut last.
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh
cut grass.
We done swam with the sharks, wrestled with
alligators.
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers,
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap.
May be raised to be racist,
Who may have never got to see our faces,
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages,
Broke down barriers of languages and races.
Just call on the Cape Crusaders,
and leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and
we can play the-
Back and forth all day,
Like the hot potato game, that's why we all
came to-
Came here to set this party off right,
Lets bounce tonight.
What the hell are you waiting for?
After me there should be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise
Yea buddy-woo-woo-woo
I've become so numb.
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar.
Every step that I take is another mistake to you.
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the
undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can
take.
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there,
Become so tired, so much more aware,
I'm becoming this, all I want to do,
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb.
Can I get an encore?
Do you want more?
Bounce now, hands up you know how we do.
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret everybody know.
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money
involved
And plenty honey's involved,
The sunny Sundays and palm trees Cali,
Everyday's just another party from the valleys,
All the way to them
8-mile alley lets rally(8 mile alley lets rally)
Hands up for the grand finale,
Now raise up out your seat,
Dre's about to speak.
Blaze a pound of weed,
Six days up out the week.
You could catch me in the studio, bangin' out
the beats to
Provide you with the heat, that keep blazin' out
your speaker.
So never say never cause Shady Aftermath
together
Along with G-Unit Records present the return of
the
Doc and Shady
No one can do it better
We tear up the club and leave without a strand
of evidence uh
Now can I get an encore?
Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy,
So for one last time I need y'all to roar,
uh-uh-uh-uh.
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to-"

was brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over
Scars begin to fade
You said it was forever
But then it slipped away
Standing at the end of
The final masquerade,The final masquerade,All I've ever wanted
The secrets that you keep
All you've ever wanted
The truth I couldn't speak
Cuz I can't see forgiveness
And you can't see the crime,If we both keep on waiting
For what we left behind,The light on the horizon

Lightweights steppin' aside when we come in
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping
People on the street then panic and start running
Words on loose leaf sheet, complete coming
I jump in my mind, I summon the rhyme I'm dumping
Healing the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumping
Risk something, take back what's yours
Say something that you know they might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I had before
Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you, in the back of their jet
When you can't put gas in your tank, these fuckers
Are laughing their way to the bank, and cashing their check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
In the living room, laughing like, ""What did he say?"",Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen,Amen,In my living room watching it, But I am not laughing
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The war is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react to get blown into fractions
At 10 years old, there's something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought 'the next one could be me'
Do you see the soldiers that are out today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, and your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine on the back
He hand-wrote a quote inside
""When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die""
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay,The rest of the world watching at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like ""What did he say?"",Amen
Amen,Amen
Amen
Amen,With hands held high into a sky so blue
The ocean opens up to swallow you
With hands held high into a sky so blue
The ocean opens up to swallow you
With hands held high into a sky so blue
The ocean opens up to swallow you
With hands held high into a sky so blue
The ocean opens up to swallow you
With hands held high into a sky so blue
The ocean opens up to swallow you
With hands held high into a sky so blue

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time,All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away,It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or wasted it all just to watch you go,I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when,I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter,One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how,I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised,It got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end,You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when,I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter,I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know,I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know,I tried so hard and got so far

I'm losing what I don't deserve,It's in the blackened bones
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve,I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve,The blame is mine alone
For bridges I have burned
So don't apologize

The blood of innocence burning in the skies"

All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together

Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake,For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony,They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse
When they turn down the lights,I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together

Pick myself up off the ground

Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep,Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said,Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell,Should've played it safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn't understand
Never could've planned
They made me who I am
Put your nose on paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These are years you're never getting back,Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said,Sharp edges have consequences, I

We live somehow
We learn what doesn't kill us makes us stronger

Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?,Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?,Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again,By myself I ask why, but in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
By myself I ask why, but in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself,I can't hold on
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin

I can't hold on
To anything watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in,If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone,If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer,By myself I ask why, but in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
By myself I ask why, but in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself,I can't hold on

With thoughts of failure sinking in,How do you think I've lost so much
I'm so afraid that I'm out of touch
How do you expect... I will know what to do
When all I know Is what you tell me to,Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside,Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why

Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here

(Don't you come back no more),Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from,So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear

Good goodbye
Good goodbye,Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong,(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here

Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more),Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I gotta tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe's
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang,So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here

Yo, peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like
Rewind that we're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime there are those who wanna talk this and that
So I suppose that it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt,It goes
Tried to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening
Called to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear,But nobody's listening
I got a heart full of pain
Head full of stress
Head full of anger,Held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more
I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that it's better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
Never forget the blood sweat and tears
The uphill struggle over years the fear and
Trash talking and the people it was to,And the people that started it just like you
Tried to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening
Called to you so clearly
But you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear,But nobody's listening
I got a heart full of pain
Head full of stress
Head full of anger
Held in my chest
Uphill struggle
Blood sweat and tears
Nothing to gain,Everything to fear
Heart full of pain
Head full of stress
Head full of anger
Held in my chest
Uphill struggle
Blood sweat and tears
Nothing to gain,Everything to fear
Heart full of pain,Heart full of pain
Tried to give you warning
But everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear
But nobody's listening
Called to you so clearly

Replacing this pain with something numb.
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone.,Something has been taken from deep inside of me,
A secret I've kept locked away, no one can ever see.
Wounds so deep they never show, they never go away,
Like moving pictures in my head, for years and years they've played.,If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would

It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone.,Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past,
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have.
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back,
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past.,If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would
If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would

If I could stand up and take the blame, I would,
I would take all my shame to the grave.,Just washing it aside,
All of the helplessness inside,
Pretending I don't feel misplaced,
Is so much simpler than change.,It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb.
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone.,It's easier to run!
If I could change, I would take back the pain, I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made
It's easier to go!

I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right (halfway right),Told me ""Kid, you're going way to fast
You burn too bright, you know you'll never last""
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now
I woke up driving my car
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far,All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone,I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right, halfway right,Na na na na na na na na
Nana nana, na nana nana

When a man has plans of being rich
If he falls off his plans, he's wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split
Nonsense the same, he didn't call for this, he's filthy
Talk team, they take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty
Anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, you claim that ain't the way that he built me
Smoke scream, we're going in flames
Know as soon as they're done what the deal be
Say it's time for things to change
We arrange that dope product we built cheap
Anything if it's more to gain
Dream, manipulated like artists, it's real deep
Until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock, to pop and radio
You record companies kill me
Try to force me to strain it, no way
They got the gall to say ""yo, how real can real be?""
You feel me? you will see, the greed will be to blame
Greedy for the fame, TV or a name
Media, the game, to me your all the same
You're guilty,You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame,You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger

And my eyes are wide awake,For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony,They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender no illusions
And for better or worse,When they turn down the lights,I hear my battle symphony

I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste,Your sugar

Little love and little sympathy

There ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than southern California Bay,I don't wanna play no games

Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong

The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me,You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down,I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise,I'm at a payphone trying to call home

'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away,You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care

I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing,Made it from the bottom
Now, when you see me I'm stunning
And all of my cars start with a push of a button,Telling me the chances I blew up, or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone, so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show, you can tell it, I'm balling,Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw, but sad to say it's over for,Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you,I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong

So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical

This double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to ' tread the ground that I am walking on,When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say

Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

You should know better you never listened to a word I said,Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat

Does it burn
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control
Does it thrill
Does it sting

And you wish that you had me to hold,When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love

You said you wished you did not love me anymore
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said and did have left permanent scars,Obsessed, depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I've been lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine,She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there,It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have,Cuz' I can't believe that it's over,You've hit your low, you've lost control and you want me back
You may not believe me but I gave you all I have
Undress, confess that you're still mine
I roll around in a bed full of tears, and
I'm still lying in the dark no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine,She cries

Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have,No I can't believe that it's over now, baby,So much to say, it's not the way she does her hair
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes
And in my darkest day when she refused to run away
From love she tried so hard to save...,It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have

Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep,We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day,I switched the four door to the two door

Oh, can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't
I know I don't know you

I don't know if I will find you

And I feel a little better than I did before

Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin

Promise not to leave me behind,Take me down but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time,'Cause you keep me coming back for more

got bills to pay, get out my way it's time to move on
And dinner with your boyfriend will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him...,I miss you, I love you
its a shame you can't stay away from me this time oh no
You beg me you ask me
To kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
oh no, 'cause I don't need you
And I miss you, I love you
its a shame you can't stay away from me this time oh no
You beg me, you ask me to
Kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
'cause oh no, 'cause I don't need you tonight."

There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight,With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart,Yes, you're lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm

Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call

Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all,You ain't ever coming back to me

The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you, oh
Cause I remember very well,And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you
And at night when you sleep
Did you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you?,You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that,Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
There is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you,You ain't ever coming back to me

Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle

Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time

All of our bridges burned down,I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise...,I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?,If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit (video), it (album and radio)
One more fucking(video), stupi(album and radio) love song, I'll be sick,You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away,You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down,I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise...,I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?,If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit (video), it (album and radio)
One more fucking (video), stupid (album and radio) love song I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone...,Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing,Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stuntin'
And all cars start with the push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone so you never could call it,Don't need my name on my show, you can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw,But sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you,I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two,If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairy tales are full of shit
Yeah, one more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone..."

Now I got my freedom, don't I?
I parked my car outside your house,Hoping someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found the way to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I
May be losing my mind,Shy girl, so humble
With eyes that make me stumble
Somehow, not speaking
Lets me know everything
I go out, you eat in
Hide from the situation
You're naked in daylight,Wrap yourself up in goodnight
I'm burning, I'm hungry
Angry 'cause she don't love me,You've got me completely
In my own game you beat me

I've fallen hard this time,But I'm not giving in
I want the world to know
That I won't let you forget
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go

Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up, and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you,That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave,Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah
Paint a picture with my hands
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends,That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me

And I never want to leave

Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
Find a way to bring myself back home to you,You may not know
That may be all I need

Who will dance on the floor in the round,People always told me ""be careful of what you do""
""And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
And mother always told me ""be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"",Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son,For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice,She told ""my baby, that's a threat""
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying
Eyes were like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby,People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon

No, she is not just my baby
But the kid is not my son,She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

You try to scream,But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

Thriller at night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike,You know it's thriller,Thriller at night

Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand,And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes,And hope that this is just imagination
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time

Against the thing with the forty eyes, girl,Thriller

The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb

And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist

Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms

When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road your walking on
A sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone

Boy is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none,And I told about equality
An it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil,I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business,Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody,Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations,Causing grief in human relations,It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces,Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color,Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother

It's tough for you to get by

Ain't nobody's business! (You knock me off of my feet!)
Ain't nobody's bussines,

I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came,You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say i love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer,I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps
And angels sing,You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life
Without you,I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you,I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if i stop
Then tell me just what
Will I do
'cause I just can't stop loving you,At night when the
Stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true,When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you,You know how i feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying ""I do""
""I do""
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't
Worth living
If i can't be with you,I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you,We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey
Farewell To sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always,I just can't stop loving you
No, baby
Oh!
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!

In the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops
Your heart
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before
You make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between
The eyes
You're paralyzed,'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to
Strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight,You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere
Left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see
The sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just
Imagination
But all the while you hear the creature creepin' up
Behind
You're out of time,'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with
Forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight,Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life,They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on
Every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on
Your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close
Together
All through the night I'll save you from the terrors on
The screen
I'll make you see,That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost
Would ever dare try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller
Chiller
Thriller here tonight,That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost
Would ever dare try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller,Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell,The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller"

A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid,Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart, soft and blue,Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.,In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood,Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat,Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now,Planet Earth, are you just

She's So Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous,Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey
But You're No Damn Good For Me
She Came At Me In Sections
With The Eyes Of Desire
I Fell Trapped Into Her,Web Of Sin
A Touch, A Kiss,A Whisper Of Love
I Was At The Point
Of No Return
Deep In The Darkness Of,Passion's Insanity
I Felt Taken By Lust's
Strange Inhumanity
This Girl Was Persuasive
This Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous
I Never Knew,But I Was Living In Vain
She Called My House
She Said You Know My Name
And Don't You Pretend
You Never Did Me Before
With Tears In Her Eyes,My Baby Walked Out The Door
She's So Dangerous,The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey,But You're No Damn Good For Me
Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
I Have To Pray To God
'Cause I Know How,Lust Can Blind
It's A Passion In My Soul
But You're No Damn Lover
Friend Of Mine
I Can not Sleep Alone Tonight
My Baby Left Me Here Tonight
I Cannot Cope 'Til It's All Right
You And Your Manipulation,You Hurt My Baby
And Then It Happened
She Touched Me
For The Lips Of
A Strange Woman
Drop As A Honeycomb,And Her Mouth Was
Smoother Than Oil
But Her Inner Spirit And Words
Were As Sharp As
A Two-Edged Sword
But I Loved It,'Cause It's Dangerous
Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey,But You're No Damn Good For Me
Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time

I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price

But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone?,And
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?,When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?,When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair
âE Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much,That's why
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me

I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
(Who's watching?)
Well is the mailman watching me?
(Tell me who's watching?)
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now
(Who?!)
The IRS?!,I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy

Tell me, is it just a dream?,I always feel like somebody's watching me

When all I can do is sigh, I just wanna touch you,I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflys inside, inside and I,All I gotta say is that, I must be dreaming can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near to me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen

Just make my dreams come true

The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold,And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will i do?,And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still i cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'cause i'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?,(who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(who is it?)
Is it my brother!
(who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more,I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me,And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will i do!,And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right

She just up and ran away,(who is it?)

Somebody hurt my soul, now

A capricious anomaly in the sea of space,Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid,Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart, soft and blue,Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.,In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood,Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat,Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now,Planet Earth, are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid,Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue

Do you care, have you a part

Alive with music, haunting my soul.

I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be,How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside,Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a begger boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be,How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)

How does it feel (How does it feel now)

a fire burns inside me

Unbreakable
Now I'm just wondering why you think
That you can get to me with anything
Seems like you'd now by now
When and how I get down
And with all that I've been through, I'm still around,Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby,You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable,Now you can't stop me even though you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughin', while surfacing,Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me

And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable,You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm stll gonna be here
Through all your lies and silly games
I'm a still remain the same, I'm unbreakable,Uh, uh, what, uh
A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringin in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly nines and macs
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them
HELLO?!
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'telle you in
Crack braggin sick of braggin how my mink be draggin
Desert E's street sweepers inside the beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin with the devil
WHAT!!,You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable,You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it

Last night, an angel came to me
I was cryin' alone
My heart was bleeding
Last night, an angel came to me
I was cryin' alone
My mind was dying
God have mercy
Stop them destroying me
An angel came to me
To save my life
Listen to his voice
Please hear his soul
This angel came to me
To save me
Last night, an angel came to me
I was doing wrong (x2)
Last night, an angel came to me
I was sleepin' wrong (x2)

Stop them destroying me
An angel came to me
To forgive me
Listen to his prayers
Please feel his love
This angel came to me
God saved me
An angel came to me
To fulfill his prophecy
He listened to my prayers
Please feel my love

Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel
But I am speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel

But in your presence I am lost for words

My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat,So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist,I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there,Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
No Name,As she took me right through the fog
I see a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
No one's in fear,She said this is the place where no people have pain
And in love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend,Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah,Yeah Yeah,She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen things I've never done
This place really looks like a lotta fun,I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
and not a world could I wanna leave,So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world,Ooh-ooh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
No name,Take me to a place without no name

in every living thing

love will take us to a place where
god can be seen,this is my dream,I have this dream

I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed
I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting
Here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you
Guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt,The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here,'cause baby,When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together,I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep(too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And its' breakin' my heart
I'm tryin' to keep it together
But I'm falling apart,I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, crying tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life baby,When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby baby
We belong together,When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please,'cause

Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up

With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song,We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long
Before we knew we could, yes,There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe,In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I cant explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say,There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe,An' though they don't always happen when you ask
And its easy to give in, to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says help is very near,There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah, though hope is frail)
Though hope is frail (It's hard)
Its hard to kill (Hard to kill, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you believe (When you)
You will when you

You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away,And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth,That a hero lies in you,It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself,And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear,And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone,Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you,Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you

Underneath the mistletoe,I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for St. Nick,I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click,Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding onto me so tight,What more can I do
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you,All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of childrens'
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me
The one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me, quickly
I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own

This is for my people who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky
Cause we won't ever say bye,As a child, there were them times
I didn't get it, but you kept me alive
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things separation brings,You never let me know it, you never let it show,Because you loved me, and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today, face to face
Never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on I
Wish I could talk to you for awhile,Miss you but I try not to cry
As time goes by,And its true that you've reached a better place,Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you

I wish that we could spend the holidays together

I thought you were so strong
You'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever,Never knew I could hurt like this,And everyday life goes on I

I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know
I gotta shake you off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means
I gotta shake you off
I gotta shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake shake, shake it off
I just gotta shake you off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games

I gotta shake, shake it off

So far away,Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
Alive,[Chorus:]
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day,Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared,[Chorus],Although the sun will never shine the same again
I'll always look to a brighter day
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray,[Chorus],Sorry I never told you

I would've stayed
if you said we could've made everything okay
but we just
through the blame back and forth.
We treated love like a sport
the final blow hit so low I'm still on the ground.
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall.,Shattered in pieces curled on the floor. Supernatural love conqueres.
Remember we used to touch the sky.
And lightning don't strike.
The same place twice.,When you and I
Said goodbye
I felt the angels cry.
Cause true loves a gift.
But we let it drift
In the storm.
Every night
I feel the angels cry.
Come on babe can our love be revived.,Bring it back and we gon' make it right.
I'm on the edge just trying to survive.
As the angels cry.
Limitless omnipresent kind of love,Couldn't have guessed it, would just stop
And disappear, in a world where
Here I am
Walking on this narrow road.
Wobbling but won't let go.
Waiting for a glimpse of the suns glow.
I know I can stand just pull me back up.,Like there aint a hurricane its just us.
I'm willing to live and die for our love.
Baby we can get back that shine.
And lightning don't strike.
The same place twice.
When you and I,Said goodbye
I felt the angels cry.
Cause true loves a gift.
But we let it drift,In the storm.
Every night
I feel the angels cry.
Come on babe can our love be revived.
Bring it back and we gon' make it right.
I'm on the edge just trying to survive.
As the angels cry.
Baby I'm missin' you
Don't allow love to lose,We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
Baby I'm missin' you
Don't allow love to lose,We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
And lightning don't strike.
The same place twice.

Cause true loves a gift.

Over, over, don't break down yet, it's over
Over, over, steady breakin' me on down, ooh
Break, breakdown, steady breakin' me on down
Break, breakdown, steady breakin' me on down,You call yesterday to basically say that you care for me
But that you're just not in love immediately, I pretended
To feel similarly and led you to believe I was okay
To just walk away from the thing that's unyielding and sacred to me,Well, I guess, I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going the extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my my mind
Underneath the guise of a smile gradually, I'm dying inside,Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal that fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry,So what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through,Do you cling to your pride and sing, ""I will survive""?
(Gotta get control and roll, roll, roll on)
Do you lash out and say ""How dare you leave leave this way""?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away?,Well, I guess, I'm trying to be nonchalant about it

(Don't let it)
Crazy situations rockin' my mind, tryin' to break me down
But I won't let it, forget it
If ya feel the same way that I do, then let me help y'all,All singin' tunes, sayin', ""It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, yeah""
Hopin' for the sun but it looks like rain, P.O.D'ed but it's still the same
Came far but it's been a long road
Trouble's gonna come but we gotta stay strong, hold on,Aw, yeah, I often feel the pressures, y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall, it's over
It's endin' here, I said it's over, it's endin' here
(Here, here)
So I'll be on my way and maybe we can meet up in the future one day,But for now I'm bailin', bailin', bailin', baby, gotta get up
Can't take no more, I'm headed for the door
Come and take a look into a thug humble eye
Tell me, if we lived a lie, would our souls unite?,Every new day is a test for me
So I just pray the Lord for Him to bless me, please
There's struggles I'm goin' through lately
Breaks me down, set me free, let me be, let me be,Who else do I have to rely on? Whose shoulder can a thug go cry on?
Can I get my vibe on? While you look into my eyes
You won't underestimate and this soldier story
I'm'a tell you right now I'm fed up,Wrong if I let my lead bust? Pac said keep your head up
Don't let this world get the best of you
I'm a stress you through it, if it's over, over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over,Well, I guess, I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going the extremes to prove I'm fine without you

Until you saved my life,Thank God I found you (Yeah yeah)
I was lost without you (I was lost),My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you,I will give you everything (Everything),There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do (Oh no),To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive
Don't wanna try (I don't wanna try)
If you keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life,Thank God I found you (I'm thanking you)
I was lost without you (So lost without you),My every wish and every dream (Every wish, every dream)
Somehow became reality,When you brought the sunlight (Brought the sunlight)
Completed my whole life (Completed)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude (Overwhelmed with gratitude)
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you,See I was so desolate before you came to me,Looking back (Looking back)
I guess it shows that we were destined
To shine over the rain to appreciate,The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel
This way (This way)
Oh, thank God I found you (Yeah yeah)
I was lost without you (Lost without you baby)
My every wish and every dream (And every dream)
Somehow became reality,When you brought the sunlight (Brought the light)
Completed my whole life (My whole life)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
See baby I'm so thankful I found you
Oh, thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude (So overwhelmed)
My baby I'm so thankful I found
You, you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby I'm so thankful I found (I found you)

When all I can do is watch you leave
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain

Turn around and see me cry

So many reasons why

When that's what I've got to face.,Take a good look at me now
Cause I'll be standing here

And you coming back to me is against all odds
And that's the chance I've got to take.
Got to take
Got to take
Ooh

I had a dream
Someday you and me will find ourselves In love again,Each day of my life, I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I, I am not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp I'll hold it with both hands
It' s worth the risk of burning to have a second chance,No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby

With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hope for a song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know theres much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could whoa yes
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe,Mmmyeah

When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now im standing here
My hearts so full, i cant explain
Seeking faith and speakin words
I never thought id say

And its easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says hope is very near, oh
There can be miracles (miracles)

Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart,Gimme your love (8x),It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know are stated
To relinquish my love to you
But I can not resist at all,Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
Or leave me feelin' blue
Would you go and break my heart?,Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessently
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart,(Jay-Z rap):
OK
Cool

Yo
She wanna shop wit Jay
Play box wit Jay
She wanna pillowfight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spyin' again
She wanna roll wit Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight wit lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna respect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand a hair longer than hers
She want
Make love in the Jacuzzi
Rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib,
Keys to da newbie
She wanna
Answer the phone
Tattoo her arm
Last one I got her
Sent it back to her mom
She call me heartbreaker
When we apart it makes her
Wanna piece of paper,
Scribble down 'I hate ya'
But she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does, and a...,Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessently
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart,Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?

Anything they want to you,
If you let them in,
But they won't ever win,
If you cling to you pride, and just push them aside,

Something in my soul that they can not possess

Anything they want to say,
Try to bring me down,
But I won't face the ground,
I will rise steadily sailing out of their reach,

Painting on a smile with lipstick
Putting on a big charade
So difficult to keep pretending
It's getting harder everyday
It's plain to see I'm cold and arctic
Since you turned and walked away
I just keep going round and round
And round in circles
Keep on tumbling down,[chorus]
Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around in circles over you
(running around in circles over you),Saturday I saw you
Holding hands with someone new
Somehow I kept my composure
Just like everything was cool
But inside I kept repeating
Don't you let them see you cry
So I casually turned my head
As the tears rolled down my eyes
I just keep going round and round
And round in circles
Keep on tumbling down,[chorus]
Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around in circles over you,Everything is you
How can I pull through
My heart is consumed I'm so confused
Still caught up in you... love can be so cruel
Baby don't know how to turn you loose,[chorus]
Oh boy my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
No, nothing's the same

I no longer live in your dominion (no, no, no, ooh)
You're just trifling, nothing more than a liability
Gotta lay all your possessions
Outside the kitchen window right now,Letting go, letting go ain't easy
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful
'Cause somebody you used to know
It's flinging your world around
And they watch, as you're falling down, down, down
Falling down, baby,Evidently your words were merely lies
Reverberating in my ears
And the echo won't subside
There's a deep deep loss of hope
And the anger burns in me
I hope you don't get no ideas 'bout re-uniting baby
'Cause that's the last thing I truly need
Your audacity is too much to be believed, so
Go to MiMi on your contacts, press delete,Letting go ain't easy
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful
'Cause somebody you used to know
It's flinging your world around
And they watch, as you're falling down, down
Down, down,Baby letting go, baby letting go
Ain't easy, ain't easy
Baby letting go, baby letting go (woah)
Ain't easy, ain't easy,Baby letting go, it ain't easy
'Cause somebody you used to know
It's flinging your world around
And you know what?
They watch as you're falling, as you're falling
Down
Fall
It ain't easy baby"

Starry eyed
As you put your hand in mine...,It was twilight
On the Fourth of July
Sparkling colors were
Strewn across the sky
And we sat close enough
That we just barely touched
While roman candles
Went soaring above us and baby,Chorus
Then you put your hand in mine
And we wandered away
I was trembling inside
But I wanted to stay
Pressed against you there
And leave the world behind
On that Fourth of July,So starry eyed
On the flower hillside
Breathless and fervid
Amid the dandelions
As it swept over me
Like the wind through the trees
I felt you sigh with a
Sweet intensity and baby,Chorus
Then you put your hand in mine
And we floated away
Delicately lay entwined
In an intimate daze
A crescent moon began to shine
And I wanted to stay
Tangled up with you among the fireflies,(Bridge)
Thunder clouds
Hung around
So threateningly
Ominously hovering
And the sky
Opened wide
Showering,Chorus
Then you put your hand in mine
And we ran from the rain
Tentatively kissed goodnight
And went our seperate ways
And I've never truly felt the way that I
Felt the Fourth of July,(Outro)
Truly I have never felt the same inside
Like that Fourth of July
Truly I could never feel the same as I
Felt that Fourth of July"

You know who you are,Hmm hmm hmm
When glory days turn to stormy nights
You must have been so petrified
-Didn't you? didn't you feel so cold
You against the world in a losing fight
Captive of your demons inside
So you sought an enemy
-I'm not your enemy, he lives in you, you know it's true
Like times before to mock ignorantly
-But the Lord said love your enemy so just...
Take heed to the Word it's time
Check Proverbs 19: 29 don't cry,I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well,I truly wanted solidarity
Still wearing my blinders back then
-So much I didn't see
I weep for what I dreamed we all could be
I'll keep you in prayer till the end
Still bruised still walk on eggshells
Same frightened child hide to protect myself
-Can't believe I still need to protect myself from you
But you can't manipulate me like before
Examine first John chapter 4 verse 4
And I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
-Be strong in the Lord and the power of His might,If my shows of gratitude are miniscule
Inside your mind, sorry
(I'm so sorry, please forgive me)
There's only so much I can do
I love you and I did all that I could,Maybe when you're cursing me
You don't feel incomplete
But we've all made mistakes
Felt the guilt and self-hate
I know you've been there for plenty
Maybe still got love for me
But let him without sin cast the first stone brethren
But who remains standing then
Not you not I see Phillipians 4: 9
-Put it into practice and the God of Peace will be with you,So I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
-He who the Son sets free is free indeed,No weapon formed against me
Shall prosper
Surely God is my salvation
I will trust and not be afraid
The Lord, the Lord is my salvation
I will trust in Him
Yes, I know that I know that I know that I know
But I have had God's help to this very day
And so I stand here and testify to small and great alike
So the more you curse me the more you're blessing me
The Word said it
Love your enemies
Do good to those who curse you
Pray for those who mistreat you
Psalms 129: 2
They have greatly oppressed me from my youth
But they have not gained victory over me
-In Jesus' name
I wish you well
-He that keeps his mind state on the Lord
-He will keep them in perfect peace"

Nobody can take your place

It wasn't raining yet
But it was definitely a little misty on
That warm november night
And my heart was pounding
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But i just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And i was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
(and i was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark
Chorus 1
Every time i feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and i
On the rooftop that rainy night
Verse 2
And so we finished the moet and
Started feeling liberated
And i surrendered as you took me
In your arms
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So i threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced i'd suppressed
For such a long time
(and i was lifted)
And for a while i forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood
There in the rain
Chorus 2
Every time i feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and i
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time i feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and i
On the rooftop that rainy night
Bridge
Last night i dreamed that i
Whispered the words i love you
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
(pretty baby - how i'm missing you)
Chorus 3
Every time i feel the need
I envision you caressing me
(envision you caressing me)
And go back in time
(i go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and i
On the rooftop that rainy night
(on the roof that rainy night)
Chorus 4
Every time i feel the need
(when i feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(i envision you over and over and over again)
And go back in time
(i go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and i
(it was oh so sweet you and i)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(on that rainy night)
Chorus 5
Every time i feel the need
(last night i had the strangest dream...)
I envision you caressing me
(i was actually quite symbolic)
And go back in time
(as i whispered... that i loved you)
To relieve the splendor of you and i
(...very subtly)
Chorus 6
Every time i feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time

Another hit, okay
We lookin' fine, takin' off
Saw us on a runway
On any given Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday
They try to confuse me,
I never let 'em use me,I was a girl, you was a man
I was too young to understand
I was naive, I just believed
Everything that you told me
Said you were strong, protecting me
Then I found out that you were weak
Keepin' me there, under your thumb
Cause you were scared that I'd become much
More than you could handle,
Shining like a chandelier
That decorated every room inside
The private hell we built,
And I dealt with it
Like a kid I wished I could fly away,But instead, I kept my tears inside
Cause I knew if I started I'd keep crying
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it but I still live with the side effects,Wakin' up scared some nights still dreaming 'bout the violent times
Still little protective 'bout the people that I let inside
Still little defensive thinkin folk be tryna run my life
Still little depressed inside, I fake a smile and deal with the side effects
(Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh)
Side effects (Oh, oh),It didn't stop, no one was there
Couldn't be real, had to keep quiet
Once in awhile, put up a fight
It's just too much, night after night
After awhile I would just lie,
You was dead wrong, said you was right
Did what I could, just to survive
Couldn't believe this was my life,
Flickering like a candle
Do my best to handle sleeping with the enemy
Whether he was smothering every last part of me
So I broke away and finally found the strength to leave,Still kept the tears inside
Cause I knew if I started I'd keep crying
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it but I still live with the side effects,Wakin' up scared some nights still dreaming 'bout the violent times

Gotta keep ya sucka smilin'
Keep tryin' to play
I tell him I ain't blowin' tho
Think they want me outta here,

You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know,No one you'll ever find will be
Closer to all your dreams than me,Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself, ""I just don't need her now""
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other
Someday, oh, someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for,Someday, hey, hey
Boy, you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you should have known,Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now,'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me inspite of all the others
Someday, oh, someday,One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy, you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, oh, someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy, you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Maybe now you just can't conceive,That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe,That another could replace me, the one and only?
But when you are down in your time of need
And you're thinking that you might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause I won't need your love anymore
Someday, oh, someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy, you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, oh, someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy, you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, oh, someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy, you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, oh, someday"

We had something good,But I should have had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walking by you
Boy don't you even speak
Pretend you on the sofa,And I'm on the tv

See me at a show

Yo, Mariah Carey alongside Gong Marley
Huh, natty, check it, pepper!

Can't explain it but it's somethin' 'bout him
Makin me hot like a motor revvin' over and over
It don't stop, he cruised beside me now I'm flyin', driving,Through yellow lights
I'm ignorin' every sign of caution that they provide
Driver's Education 101 slipped out of my mind
I need me a caddy with some cruise control, no, no, no,I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But uh oh, I can't resist him
Just want to kiss him, I need cruise control,Might need to go slow, I don't know
Why I ease up on the brake every time I see his face
I'm outta control, I-I don't know how to stay up in my lane
Every day and night he's cruisin' through my brain,Wherever I go he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, ooh hes so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't want to lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go, gotta get on cruise control,C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control,Can't nobody, can't nobody tell me nothin'

Cause he's the flyest ting when he be cruisin'
On me avenue,When the door open, de gals pon de block
They be hopin' to rob the clock
He said, no man, step up, step up
Bottle broken, think I'm jokin'?,I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But uh oh, I can't resist him
Just want to kiss him I need cruise control,Might need to go slow, I don't know
Why I ease up on the brake every time I see his face
I'm outta control, I-I don't know how to stay up in my lane
Every day and night he's cruisin' through my brain,Wherever I go he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, ooh hes so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't want to lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go, gotta get on cruise control,You put your hand in cruise control
And you deny me if you want
And you will starve yourself of love
If you don't speed and break the law,You can't get no speeding ticket
On the highway to my heart
And it might be a rocky road
And you can exit if you want
(Why you always?)
Look at life just like a pessimist
You already like a wife up in my premises
And right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis
Just come again and stop and start just like a genesis
Might need to go slow, I don't know
Why I ease up on the brake every time I see his face
I'm outta control, I-I don't know how to stay up in my lane
Every day and night he's cruisin' through my brain

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming;
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say! does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave,On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In fully glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!,And where is that band who so vuntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution!
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.,Oh, thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war's desolation!
Bless with victory and peace, may the heav'rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust"":
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave

Scottish Army under Robert I (the
Bruce) King of Scots defeated Edward II (of Canarfon) King of England. This ended the
English rule of Scotland. Ironically in
1603 Elizabeth I, Queen of England, Wales, Ireland and France* died childless and her
second cousin James VI King of Scots
ascended to the English throne. Thus marriage achieved what the force of arms could not.
* English and later British Kings from Edward III to George III adopted the title King of
France though only one, Henry V was
actually crowned in France abd became defacto Kinf of France. Anthem text courtesy of
Andrew Williams's Homepage .,O Flower of Scotland,
When will we see
Your like again,
That fought and died for,
Your wee bit Hill and Glen,
And stood against him,
Proud Edward's Army,
And sent him homeward,
Tae think again.,The Hills are bare now,
And Autumn leaves
lie thick and still,
O'er land that is lost now,
Which those so dearly held,
That stood against him,
Proud Edward's Army,
And sent him homeward,
Tae think again.,Those days are past now,
And in the past
they must remain,
But we can still rise now,
And be the nation again,
That stood against him,

Gone the times when nations battled
For this 'Helen of the West,
Gone the days when strife and discord
Dimmed her children's toil and rest.

Stretches out a glad new way.

Guard her sons from woe and harm!

Strong in soul and strong in arm!

For the crimson flag that proudly ripples in this glorious twilight, shall not fade,
Before the last fiery hearth that is ablaze within my nation is extinguished.
For That is the star of my nation, and it will forever shine;
It is mine; and solely belongs to my valiant nation.,Frown not, I beseech you, oh thou coy crescent,
But smile upon my heroic race! Why the anger, why the rage?
This blood of ours which we shed for you shall not be blessed otherwise;
For Freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshiping nation.,I have been free since the beginning and forever shall be so.
What madman shall put me in chains! I defy the very idea!
I'm like the roaring flood; powerful and independent,
I'll tear apart mountains, exceed the heavens and still gush out!,The lands of the West may be armored with walls of steel,
But I have borders guarded by the mighty chest of a believer.
Recognize your innate strength, my friend! And think: how can this fiery faith ever be killed,
By that battered, single-fanged monster you call ""civilization""?,My friend! Leave not my homeland to the hands of villainous men!
Render your chest as armor and your body as trench! Stop this disgraceful rush!
For soon shall come the joyous days of divine promise...
Who knows? Perhaps tomorrow? Perhaps even sooner!,View not the soil you tread on as mere earth - recognize it!
And think about the shroudless thousands who lie so nobly beneath you.
You're the noble son of a martyr, take shame, hurt not your ancestor!
Unhand not, even when you're promised worlds, this paradise of a homeland.,What man would not die for this heavenly piece of land?
Martyrs would gush out should one simply squeeze the soil! Martyrs!
May God take my life, all my loved ones and possessions from me if He will,
But may He not deprive me of my one true homeland for the world.,Oh glorious God, the sole wish of my pain-stricken heart is that,
No heathen's hand should ever touch the bosom of my sacred Temples.
These adhans, whose shahadahs are the foundations of my religion,
May their noble sound last loud and wide over my eternal homeland.,For only then, shall my fatigued tombstone, if there is one, prostrate a thousand times in ecstasy,
And tears of fiery blood shall flow out of my every wound,
And my lifeless body shall gush out from the earth like an eternal spirit,
Perhaps only then, shall I peacefully ascend and at long last reach the heavens.,So ripple and wave like the bright dawning sky, oh thou glorious crescent,
So that our every last drop of blood may finally be blessed and worthy!
Neither you nor my race shall ever be extinguished!
For freedom is the absolute right of my ever-free flag;
For independence is the absolute right of my God-worshiping nation!"

We praise our heros' sacrifice,
And vow to keep our land from foes;
And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.
2.O lovely Zimbabwe, so wondrously adorned
With mountians, and rivers cascading, flowing free;
May rain abound, and fertile fields;
May we be fed, our labour blessed;
And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.
3.O God, we beseech Thee to bless our native land;
The land of our fathers bestowed upon us all;
From Zambezi to Limpopo
May leaders be exemplary;
And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.

Ukraine is not yet dead, nor its glory and freedom,
Luck will still smile on us brother-Ukrainians.
Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the sunshine,
and we, too, brothers, we'll live happily in our land.
We'll not spare either our souls or bodies to get freedom
and we'll prove that we brothers are of Kozak kin.
We'll rise up, brothers, all of us, from the Sain to the Don,
We won't let anyone govern in out motherland.
The Black Sea will smile yet, grandfather Dnipro will rejoice,
Yet in our Ukraine luck will be high.
Our persistence, our sincere toil will prove its rightness,
still our freedom's loud song will spread throughout Ukraine.
It'll reflect upon the Carpathians, will sound through the steppes,
and Ukraine's glory will arise among the people."

Here in the silence of the night,

Soldiers are we
whose lives are pledged to Ireland;
Some have come
from a land beyond the wave.
Sworn to be free,
No more our ancient sire land
Shall shelter the despot or the slave.
Tonight we man the gap of danger
In Erin's cause, come woe or weal
'Mid cannons' roar and rifles peal,
We'll chant a soldier's song
In valley green, on towering crag,
Our fathers fought before us,
And conquered 'neath the same old flag
That's proudly floating o'er us.
We're children of a fighting race,
That never yet has known disgrace,
And as we march, the foe to face,
We'll chant a soldier's song
Chorus
Sons of the Gael! Men of the Pale!
The long watched day is breaking;
The serried ranks of Inisfail
Shall set the Tyrant quaking.
Our camp fires now are burning low;
See in the east a silv'ry glow,
Out yonder waits the Saxon foe,
So chant a soldier's song.

Inki chalon se Allah bachaye,Inki fitrat mein hain be-wafaai
Jaanti hain ye saari khudaaee

Aise Gardan Jhukaayi Maza Aagaya,Shaikh Sahib Ka Imaan Bik He Gaya
Daikh Kar Husan E Saqi Pigal He Gaya
Aaj Se Pehle Ye Kitne Maghroor The
Lut Gayi Parsaayi Maza Aa gaya,Ay Fana Shukar Hai Aaj Baad E Fana
Us Ne Rakh Le Mere Pyaar Kee Aabro
Apne Haathon Se Usne Meri Qabar Par
Chaadar E Gul Charhaayi Maza Aagaya,Mere Rashk E Qamar Tu Ne Pehli Nazar
Jab Nazar Se Milaayi Maza Aa gaya..."

برق سی گر گئی، کام ہی کر گئی، آگ ایسی لگائی مزہ آ گیا
جام میں گھول کر حسن کی مستیاں، چاندنی مسکرائی مزہ آ گیا
چاند کے سائے میں اے میرے ساقیا، تو نے ایسی پلائی مزہ آ گیا
نشہ شیشے میں انگڑائی لینے لگا، بزمِ رنداں میں ساغر کھنکنے لگے
میکدے پہ برسنے لگیں مستیاں، جب گھٹا گھر کے چھائی مزہ آ گیا
بےحجبانہ وہ سامنے آ گئے، اور جوانی جوانی سے ٹکرا گئی
آنکھ اُن کی لڑی یوں میری آنکھ سے، دیکھ کر یہ لڑائی مزہ آ گیا
آنکھ میں تھی حیاہ ہر ملاقات پر، سرخ عارض ہوئے وصل کی بات پر
اُس نے شرما کے میرے سوالات پہ، ایسے گردن جھکائی مزہ آ گیا
شیخ صاحب کا ایمان مٹ ہی گیا، دیکھ کر حسنِ ساقی پگھل ہی گیا
آج سے پہلے یہ کتنے مغرور تھے، لٹ گئی پارسائی مزہ آ گیا
اے فناؔ شکر ہے آج بعدِ فنا، اُس نے رکھلی میرے پیار کی آبرو
اپنے ہاتھوں سے اُس نے میری قبر پر، چادرِ گل چڑھائی مزہ آ گیا"

Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout ya'll niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, Jon and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut- hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if they name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck wit', mad bitches we don't fuck wit'
I don't fuck wit' them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in like seasoning,And tell them bitches, blow me, Lance Stephenson,Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only,Rich niggas only, independent bitches only,Boss niggas only, thick bitches only,I got my real niggas here by my side, only,I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man
But when that's over then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought God damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key or maybe high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW, yea
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable,Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you,The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's cause I believe in something, I stand for it,And Nicki if you ever try to fuck
Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it,I never fucked Nicki and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she act like she need dick in her life
But that's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend would beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mother's instead
You got the hiccups, you swallow the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, street beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout running in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes wit me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang take the B off behavior, my nigga
For reals if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off, nigga
Now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in the clip, one in the chamber
17 ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from poor me

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you would be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies,You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along,I'mma ask on the song,Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved,But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies,I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone,They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song,So does she know I've been in that bed before
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth,If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself,Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?

Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way,Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become near when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood,They start coming and I start rising,Must be surprising, I'm just summising

Suffocating everytime it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined,I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear,That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no muthafucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days,Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nays become yays

I'ma give bitches time to get hot,Chill out at the game, New York, nigga buck
If they actually got bars, they could rock
But if not, I'ma destroy chicks a lot
But on the real, I'm album mode
Just dropped this freestyle 'fore these files get old
When I lay low, bitches be safe and sound
When I come back, they better not make a sound
I hear you!
When I'm back on the prowl
You bitches better have my money
'Cause I'm coming for you!
Uh, okay, I order rich bitch sauce,Rich bitch cold, got a rich bitch cough,Which bitch want it? I'll go rich bitch off
'Cause you know my style gettin' bit ripped off!
When I'm at the restaurant, rich bitch sauce
Rich bitch cold, I got a rich bitch cough,Which bitch want it? I go rich bitch off
'Cause you know my style gettin' bit ripped off!
I'm a boss, I'm a boss

Uh, I'm in my prime, Optimus Sagittarius, so you know I'm an optimist
Man, keep it all real, I'm a prophetess (okay)
So at least you took an L off your bucket list (bucket list)
It's time to make hits and it's time to diss How you still dissin', still can't find some hits? (Okay)
Was it worth it, dummy? I ain't mind a bit Still on that show gettin' no chips, time to dip,[Pre-Chorus]

Let's be real, all you bitches wanna look like me
Wanna be in demand, get booked like me
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me
But ain't nan you hoes pussy good like me
Pussy so good his ex wanna still fight me
Face so pretty bitches wish they could slice me
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me
I cut all my niggas off, but they would still wife me (still wife me),[Verse 2]
Rap bitches tell they team, ""Make 'em like Barbie""
Had to come off IG so they can't stalk me
All they do is copy looks, steal music too
Want to see what bitches do when they lose the blueprint
I mean the pink print, ho, let it sink in
I spoke to Jay the other day, he's still the kingpin
He's still the only nigga that I woulda signed to
If I ain't sign to Wayne's perfectly designed crew
'Cause we the big 3, don't need a big speech
We made the biggest impact, check the spreadsheet
That's Lil Weezy, the Barbie and Drizzy Drake
Niggas gettin' more cheese, kissy face
I'm a bad bitch, fuck the bitch (uh)
Bitch get slick, I'ma cut the bitch
I'm a bad bitch, suck some dick (okay)
If that bitch get slick, I'll cut the bitch
I'll cut up the bitch, I'll gut the bitch (okay)
Had to fuck up the bitch, man, fuck the bitch
Won't shoot her but I will gun-butt the bitch
When we say ""Fuck the bitch"" dick-up the bitch
She was stuck-up so my niggas stuck up the bitch
Still draggin' her so don't pick up the bitch
Get the combination to the safe, drug the bitch
Know the whole operation been bugged the bitch

Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and their mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (oh)

What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it,(You know, uhn, uhn, uhn

I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record

I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul

You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now? Uhh
Do you hear me?
I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it,(You know, uhn, uhn, uhn

I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile

Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? Not important
I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet

A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was getting money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things
Ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to sing sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up, North on they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him
Put him on lock, seatbelt them
Took him out to Belgium, welcome!
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order
I call him Daddy like daughters,He like it when I get drunk
But I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa
I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy
Then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

Best friend is a dike, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight

You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight,Don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother,But fuck me like a husband

All I had to do is rub it
The genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'm a need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine
I tell her stop lying, mine and who else?
She say worry about yourself, Lil Tune,They holler at me but its you

Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose
You just a heart breaker won't let you break mine
Cause I'll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines,I lied
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied

I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the d o

That shit wasn't real it was magic
If it was a record it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic,This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you'd
Do If I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool

And I'm a toddler
You got me wanting more and more of

Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a doo-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S' on my chest cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody who plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil mama, I call him baby,Shorty I'mma only tell you this once, you the illest

Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lam'
Hot damn make me scream like Summer Jam
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha he was a Samurai
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
'S' on my chest let me get my cape on
He's so thugged out - Ghostface and Raekwon
""Konvict"" just like Akon

I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go,I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
When all is said and done, look at what we've become
I just want you to know, that I did it for you,I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love him
Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me,All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
When all is said and done, look at what we've become
I just want you to know, that I did it for you,Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint,All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end

I breeze through queens to check some bad bitches
I stunt so hard, assess the damages
Cause this that aw, this is that aw
And yes, I body bitches go get the bandages
Young yummy, fuck you got for me
I hate a phony bitch that front that chum chummy

After that the queen will still reign here
I'm Santa Clause to these hoes without a reindeer

Boarded the big jet, and got a big check

Bitches be jocking, tell by the look on they faces

7 figures on watches, I told my mama I made it
Made a deal for my project, just give me 10 mill I'm gravy
I went back to the projects, and 2 mill in Mercedes
I get head from your lady, have her bill me later
I'm on school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager
Heart break hotel, I'm in the 8 rise suite
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking playoff seat
Know that boy busy cause he balling, I like to play all week
Monday night with the 'RAW', I'm Vince McMahon with a beat
Power slamming them hammers I get you handle for free
So where the fuck is her manners, she gives brain while I tweet

Motherfucker, suck my dick, suck it,I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick,See the car is European but got imported from tokyo
Looking like a shark, the nose call it pinocchio
Well off, wealthy, lv, logo
Middle of july but the wrist on snowflow
Only do the Aspens, y'all can have the Poconos
I'm sunny and you my son
Ride the whip, 5 on the hip, live with the pies got 9 for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick, oh my know why I'm fly as it gets
Now I need an aspirin
She said you're only Cameron
Girlfriend you don't know Cameron from nowhere
So don't go tampering, you're just a nail I hammer
'Nother girl that's on my camera
My name you cannot slander at all girl watch your manners
She run and tell here mama, I think I love him, Nana
Because you sat upon my lap
Nah, I ain't Santa 
Hope they call me they call me pied piper
OJ no glove I knife her, never be a lifer
Even do Rikers cause why would I fight her, don't even like her,I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

All the boys there when she comes around my way
Straight out the driveway head to the highway
Red light, green light, got the best moves
Headlights beam bright got the best boobs
I call her double R my rough rider
We hit a couple malls then I remind her
Cuz on the road of life she is the spokesmodel
Her body tighter than a coke bottle,She super charge cars anything for Minaj
And she could only park in the superstar garage
'Cause she-she-she-she bad if anybody ask
Her bags is boss cuz her leather so soft
If it ain't of been softer tell 'em raise the offer
Used to fuck with a yellow bitch named Porsche
N-n-now it's me and her she say it's you Minaj
Red underneath her shoe, that's Louie Vuitton,La x28
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rover, I-I-I love my Range Rover
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rover, I-I-I love my Range Rover,Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash
Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash,She's so dope
You know she even help me transport the dope
That mama stay around that white like the pope
They get the canine but they can't smell the coke
Now you tell me why is it,
Now you tell me why is it
Don't need the ricker's visit
That is beacause I'm about the colour of the ghecko lizard
She L-Lewinsky hold ya bosses
Come around town 300 horses
Power she devour got them gettin' divorces
I don't stop for officers,And now we hit hydrolics
That's for the left turn
We dive the piece she got more horses than a western
You know she beat weight so she don't eat late
A vegetarian and she sippin' on that V8,They try to gas her they try to put it in her
You can't pass her, she faster than a TV dinner
Her liquors poppin'
We call it armarol
We chuck the deuces up,La x28
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rove, I-I-I love my Range Rover

(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause its too much, and its too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us,But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I met the one and your wasting your time,But you waited

Did I really pop and sign everything, I do?

Come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling real low,
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me,Oh!,Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on,Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on,You've got my life in the palm of your hands (palm of your hands)
Come and save me now
I know you can, I know you can,D-d-d-d-don't let me die young, I just want you to father my young
I just want you to be my doctor, we can get it crackin' chiropractor, I, I, I, I,I, I, I, I know you can save me
And make me feel alive,Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on

I tried to channel you in hopes that I could stare back.
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other.
You got your fans waiting. Tell me you ain't 6 feet under.
And tell that you coming back and you just took a break.
Maybe I blamed you for everything - That was my mistake.
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge.
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge.
Your earrings bamboo.
Your long nails, too.
Your BMW.
Every time you came through.
You was the brave heart.
You stole Wayne heart.
You never switched it up.
You played the same part.
But I needed to grow.
And I needed to know.
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you.
Left you in all black.
But dear, old Nicki
Please call back.,You told me you'd come when I needed you.
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling.
I can't see you.
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that.,Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour?
Money, fame and power?
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour.
I should've kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards.
There was no match for you.
Couldn't defeat your prowess.
I had to make them changes - I hope you understood.
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good.
But you was underground and I was mainstream.
I live the life now, that we would daydream.
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me.
Get on them conference calls.
Go meet them lawyers with me.
The money came. Yeah.
Tripled and quadrupled it.
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit.
And it still fucked the media.
They ridiculed you.
Never believed in ya.
They just deaded you.
Left you in all black.
But dear old Nicki.
Please call back.,You told me you'd come when I needed you.
And you said it so sweetly I believed you.
But I'm standing here calling.
I can't see you.
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that.,And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you to that.
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you to that."

Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs,Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?,Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know,Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o

Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya
Not cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and to be loved
(To love and to be loved),I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
Cause the tears don't end,Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know,Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o

that i'm fighting for the girls, that never thought they could win
cause before they could begin you told'em it was the end
but I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
got two bones to pick

which means you can breath

I know you saw the lipstick on my window
And wonder'n how many chick's been to my home

Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be,That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs

No im not dense

She was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She thinking Me, Earl, James and Jimmy
Yep she had plenty, but love for me, she didn't have any
I was inviting, her into my heart, but she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on,Please don't worry bout me I'm fine

Just not knowing, truly not knowing

That's the reason you're not here,(I know that I can do much better)
Not a single salty tear
Not a feeling in my chest

Start thinking about seeing you
Accidentally (ooh), accidentally (ooh) ooh
Suddenly out of the blue
Guess she was thinking about it too
Cause you came to get me and he saw you
Damn damn damn damn,I might be over my head, a little over my head
But I kinda like it (kinda like it)
This is not what I expected, a little over my head
But I kinda like it (kinda like it)
I kinda like it,This is so crazy yet so hard
They're fighting over me in the front yard
I don't know who I should root for
But there's one thing that I do know,I might be over my head, a little over my head
But I kinda like it (kinda like it)
This is not what I expected, a little over my head

First off let me say congratulations.,Heard that you just had a baby girl.
If she looks anything like her mother
She's the prettiest thing in the world.
Swear that I'm not tryin' to start no trouble.
Tell your fiance he can relax.

That sometimes
You don't know how to act
When you get a little tipsy
Or trippin' or flippin'

Won't show out

Get locked up

You don't know how
What you've got
'Til you lose
What you've got
When you should
Just wife her
Don't wait too late
You'll miss
A good thing
Go and get the ring
And tell her
That you wife her,The type of chick
That won't get slick
And keep you
From your kids
Won't get buck
Wild and clown
Now she's telling
All your biz
A queen
You don't have
To crown
She knows how
To hold it down
Likes to feel you
Inside her
And she tells you
Don't give out,Even though
She's temporary
She keeps it tight
Just like your married
She'll be the same
Without the ring
Cause she knows
How to play the game
And when you
Can't do without
She maxes out
The cards for you
That's the kind of girl
You need
One that you can wifey,(Chorus 2x),She'll fix
Your credit
But the Jordan's
On the debit
Better pay her back
But she insists
That you
Don't sweat it
She's no groupie
tell me I'm her
One and only
Ghetto superstar
On the right next
To my heart,(Chorus)"

To have your boy hollerin' yes (yes, yes),You're a kiss in the mornin'
Before I stretch out mornin' yawnin'
And you're mine, all mine

You're the reason that I'm smiling all the time
You are my sunshine

Somebody gon know 'bout mine
So much more than just a dime
Even when it's cold outside
I've got sunshine,Somebody gon know 'bout mine
So thankful that he's all mine
Even when it's cold outside
I've got sunshine,Hmmm... girl the way that we do
I don't gotta tell you
Nothin' phony
No fake dream to sell you,Don't gotta worry
'bout bein' untrue
My love's concrete
Thus you can't see through,*BRIDGE #2*
And when the rain clouds come
'Cuz we realistic, it ain's all fun
We gon be just fine
Long as you continue to be my sunshine
(yeah)
[repeat 1x],*CHORUS*
Baby girl
You're the reason that I'm smiling all the time

(ooh ooh ooh)
Even if it starts to rain I'll be alright
'Cuz i got my sunshine,Sunshine... you be my sunshine... u be my sunshine... yeahhh

But you lied to me
Said it's cool
If we do our thing

Lead you
On that's wrong
I change my ways

Stay this way

Baby, you stay at the top of my mind
Im holding on to your love, and girl I wont let go!
My Gemini, stay by my side, cause baby this kinda love never dies
Im holding up to your love,
and girl I wont let go, my Gemini!,Uh, cure and the illness
Fake as a fantasy, but the realest
Youre everything and nothing, all in one (all in one)
And I could love you and hate you like all at the same time
Two size of the same beautiful dime
I will admit it can be confusing
Baby, but its so much fun!,Bridge:
Compleximplicity - difficult, easy
Doesnt matter, shes the one I need!
Shes the one I need!
Lovely smile or tears
As long as she is right here
Ill be hers forever happily (ever happily)!,Chorus:
Gemini, Girl Im love with you my Gemini
Baby, you stay at the top of my mind
Im holding up to your love, and girl I wont let go!
My Gemini, stay by my side, cause baby this time love never dies
Im holding up to your love,
And girl I wont let go, my Gemini!"

Another position..
Sexy poster put you in
It's like as soon as I get done

When you was with me last
In the back sit
One lil' bit too far
Caught my attention
Don't you know I almost crashed
Dnd even if I did;
That's ok
Because your sexual healing
All I need to be alright
Fantasizing about you all day
Morning to the evening
I'm just toward the night

I done broke a few hearts, done my share of lying
I knew how to keep it quiet, I knew how to hide it
Or if I ever did get caught, I'd just deny it
If my mama knew the thangs I did, she wouldn't like it
She taught me way better, I know I knew way better
I just didn't care, running round doing whatever
With 3 of they best friends, knew 'em all together,Man, I ain't give a damn, damn
A lot of women had to deal with a boy
That was supposed to be a man, hey

One I used to pop bottles with
One I hit the top with
I know I did you wrong
Girl, I know I did you wrong
Can't forget about the one I hit the movies with
One I'm rocking my Louis with
One that did all that freaky shit
Girl, when you play this song
Just say that you'll sing along,Thinking to myself damn, damn
Had to put up with the drama of a boy
That was supposed to be a man, man, oh I

I said it was all good, it wasn't good at all
I said I was coming through and never
came through (never came through, no)
I said it was me and you and it was quite a few
All of the lies, all the tears that you've cried
If I could go back in time, then I would undo the crime
But I can't, no, I can't make it right
But at the very least I can go and apologize,Well I'm sorry, sorry
I'm sorry, sorry
I'm sorry, yeah, sorry,I'm sorry, sorry
But I appreciate you,
Couldn't be who I am today if not for what you did,
Not for what you went through
So from the bottom of my heart,
Thank you

Kahit paminsan-minsan lamang tayo nagkikita,Okey ka, sinira mo'ng araw ko
Puwede bang isoli mo'ng singsing ko,
Pambihira ka naman
Kung kelan naman ako nahuhulog sa iyo
Saka mo ako iiwan
Sa loob-loob ko lang,(Repeat Chorus),Maglalasing na lang ako,Chorus 2:
Kailangan kita
Hindi kumpleto ang buhay ko
Kapag nawalay ka sa kama ko
Pero kung may trip ka nang iba

To seek and see the colours of our fantasies
Come to life with the stroke of your soothing hands,

Stars will shine and lose their glow
But every time I try to look back, I know,You and me in love with each other

Just the two of us painting a world of our own

Falling for you fool's gold,And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you've met
But I don't regret
falling for you, fool's gold
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and,I can't see two feet in front of me
And I know in my heart you're just a moving part

Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips,Now she's feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again,If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me,And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again,Again we take the same road two days in the same clothes
And I know just what she'll say if I make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it,Tell me with your mind, body, and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start,If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me,And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again,You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?,If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me,And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again,If you're pretending from the start like this

Can mend your broken heart

But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home, oh-woah (take her home),But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door,She's not afraid of all the attention

She likes the way we kiss in the dark

Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth (what you're worth),Or maybe all her friends have told her

Talking on the phone so late (so late)

And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this
I'm just the underdog who finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world,Truly, madly, deeply, I am
Foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you caved all my walls in
So baby, say you'll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
In love with you,Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed
And wake you up with all the words that I still haven't said?
And tender touches, just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool like it was no big deal?,Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
I'll put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
'Cause here's the tragic truth if you don't feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name,And truly, madly, deeply, I am

If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
Fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none,We had some good times, didn't we?
We had some good tricks up our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end
I'll see your face again
You will find me,And you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind

Yesterday I went out to celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast,I realized you were missing
We had some good times, didn't we?
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet,But it's not the end
I'll see your face again
You will find me
And you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand,Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind
I know I'll be your anchor
Just close your eyes and see
I'll be by your side
Any time you're needing me,You will find me
And you will find me
In places that we've never been

All I know at the end of the day
is you love who you love,
there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned
from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want
at the end of the day,When the sun goes down I know that you and me and everything will be alright
And when the city's sleeping
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming
You and I can stay awake and keep on dreaming,All I know at the end of the day
is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart
even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
is you love who you love,
there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned

I want at the end of the day
At the end of the day

I want at the end of the day
You're the one that

Without blaming each other,Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds,Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes,Wake up, we both need to wake up
Maybe if we face up to this
We can make it through this,Closer, maybe we'll be closer

And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay

Touch skin

If we could only turn back time,You know I'll be

Throw the key

Don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you

Like tonight's sky,Hands are silent
Voice is numb
Try to scream out my lungs

Going back to the time
Playing games in the street
Kicking balls with my feet,There's a numb in my toes
Standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes
At the end of your bed,As I feel myself fall
Make a joke of it all,You know I'll be
Your life, your voice
Your reason to be

In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all good
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys, they were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got one little fight and my mom got scared,And said: ""You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"",I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I can say is that cab was rare
But I though 'Man Forget it'- Yo Home to Bel Air"

Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again?,Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?,Are you sleeping baby by yourself?
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Try to find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?,Tell me where you're hiding out
Where do broken hearts go?
Come on baby, 'cause I need you now
Where do broken hearts go?
Tell me, 'cause I'm ten feet down
Where do broken hearts go?,Come on baby, come and get me out
Come on baby, come and get me out
Come on baby, 'cause I need you now,Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?
Where do broken hearts go?"

Don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all,'Cause you were mine, for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember,You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love,Wish that we could be alone now
We could find some place to hide
Make the last time, just like the first time
Push your button and rewind,Don't say the word that's on your lips
Don't look at me that way
Just promise you'll remember when the sky is grey,'Cause you were mine, for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over

But I always will remember,You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love,So please don't make this any harder
We can't take this any farther
And I know there's nothing that I want to change, to change,'Cause you were mine, for the summer

You always will be my summer love (summer love)
You always will be my summer love (yeah)

My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?
You can give me the dreams that are mine anyway
You're half the world away
Half the world away
Half the world away
I've been lost, I've been found but I don't feel down,And when I leave this planet
You know I'd stay but I just can't stand it and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
And if I could leave this spirit I'd find me a hole and I'll live in it and
I can feel the warning signs running around my mind
Here I go, I'm still scratching around in the same old hole
My body feels young but my mind is very old
So what do you say?

People say, ""It's just a waste of time""
When they said, ""I should feed my head""
Well that to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
They're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you concerned about the way I feel
Tonight I'm a rock 'n roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n roll star
You're not down with who I am
Look at you now
You're all in my hands tonight
Tonight I'm a rock 'n roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n roll star
It's just rock 'n roll
It's just rock 'n roll
It's just rock 'n roll

Today's the day that all the world will see
(It's) another sunny afternoon
Yeah I'm walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow doesn't know what it doesn't know too soon,Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess that you might as well,What's the story morning glory
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory
Well,Need a little time to wake up, wake up

What's the story morning glory

Or a big film star, yes I think that I would like

To be rich and have a lot of fans
And lots of girls to prove that I'm a man
To be number one - and loved by everyone,Getting drugged up with my trendy friends
They really dig me, man, and I dig them
And the money that I spend, it is like my fame, and it's quickly gone,No more swimming in my guitar shaped pool
No more reporters at my beck and call
No more cocaine, now it's only ground chalk
And I can't afford a taxi so I have to walk,Didn't I have a nice time
Wasn't it sucha nice time
Didn't I have a nice time,I realize I should have stuck to my guns
You stood me out just like a bastard son
And I lost myself, but I know that it was wrong
And it cost me a lot,No more drinking cause now the club shuts down
And I'm out here on my arse with the rest of you clowns
I get really scared without my bodyguard
And I'm sitting all alone in my expensive yard,Didn't I have a nice time

If you can get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
Cos in a car you can go far
Just depends on what kind of car you are,La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,I met a funny looking girl
On a crowded beach in Spain
Her name was Avaline
She said she came to Spain to have a good time
But she was with her mum
Who had a face like a nun in pain
She said her name was Dot
She didn't half talk a lot
I couldn't tell if she was mad or not,La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
On my polluted beach - with all my special friends
Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
With my big house and my big car
And all my friend are there at the bar,La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
Cos in the sun they say it's fun
If you can get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
Cos in a car you can go far
It just depends on what kind of car you are,La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

A misery, she'd make from me...,...I think I'd better think it out again!,A wife you can keep, anyway,
I'd rather sleep, anyway.
Left without anyone in the world,
And I'm starting from now.
So ""how to win friends and to influence people""
--So how?,I'm reviewing the situation,
I must quickly look up ev'ryone I know.
Titled people -- with a station --
Who can help me make a real impressive show!
I will own a suite at Claridges,
And run a fleet of carriages,
And wave at all the duchesses
With friendliness, as much as is
Befitting of my new estate...,""Good morrow to you, magistrate!"",...I think I'd better think it out again.,So where shall I go -- somebody?
Who do I know? Nobody!
All my dearest companions
Have always been villains and thieves...
So at my time of life
I should start turning over new leaves...?,I'm reviewing the situation.
If you want to eat -- you've got to earn a bob!
Is it such a humiliation
For a robber to perform an honest job?
So a job I'm getting, possibly,
I wonder who my boss'll be?
I wonder if he'll take to me...?
What bonuses he'll make to me...?
I'll start at eight and finish late,
At normal rate, and all... but wait!,...I think I'd better think it out again.,What happens when I'm seventy?
Must come a time...seventy.
When you're old, and it's cold
And who cares if you live or you die,
Your one consolation's the money
You may have put by...,I'm reviewing the situation.
I'm a bad 'un and a bad 'un I shall stay!
You'll be seeing no transformation,
But it's wrong to be a rogue in ev'ry way.,I don't want nobody hurt for me,
Or made to do the dirt for me.
This rotten life is not for me.
It's getting far too hot for me.
There is no in between for me
But who will change the scene for me?
Don't want no one to rob for me.
But who will find a job for me,...I think I'd better think it out again!,Hey!"

It's a fine life!,It's a fine life!,But the grass is green and dense
On the right side of the 'fence'.,And we take good care of it
That we get our share of it
And we don't mean pence.,No! If you don't mind having to like or lump it...
It's a fine life,It's a fine life!,Tho' there's no tea-supping and eating crumpet
It's a fine life!,It's a fine life!,Not for me, the happy home
Happy husband, happy wife
Tho' it sometimes touches me...

For a glimpse of her smile
And the touch of her hand,The touch of her hand lyin' soft in mine
I feel as tall as the mountains and I'm
Anything I could hope to be
With the touch of her hand,Half-kept promises
And dreamer's hopes
Love by phone
And ""miss you"" notes
And I meant to give so much more
Well, so much for plans,But if she thinks that I've let her down
Chasin' fool's gold from town to town
You would never know by the love in her eyes
Or the laugh in her voice
Or the touch of her hand,The touch of her hand lyin' soft in mine

There'd be so much left undone
And I would never grow wings
Should there be a need to delay my certain sunset
Will there be a plan for me to try?,I know the only way to fly
I must find a golden eagle
Resting somewhere on the ground
And ride him ever westward
Never see the sun go down,Sometimes the challenge presses hard upon my brow
And I know the time is now
But my wits are stiff and swollen
I pay my dues and limp a rough and rocky climb
As I try to buy some time
Before the dark has fallen,I am but a man
Can I stop encroaching shadows?
Would that I could keep the black away
I have a scheme to save the day,I will find a golden eagle
Resting somewhere on the ground
And ride him ever westward
Never see the sun go down
And I'll ride him for circles
A hundred million times
And then if I have finished
All the half-done chores that I'm now facing
I'll bring him on home"

He acts the way he thinks he should.
But all the same,
I'll play
This game
His way.,As long as he needs me...
I know where I must be.
I'll cling on steadfastly...
As long as he needs me.,As long as life is long...
I'll love him right or wrong,
And somehow, I'll be strong...
As long as he needs me.,If you are lonely
Then you will know...,When someone needs you,
You love them so.,I won't betray his trust...
Though people say I must.,I've got to stay true, just

Steppin' out the frame I'm in

You see my world is feeling like it just might explode

And I'd hear the same voice
Echo in my mind
Said 'son you got an angel,
To chase the devil at the night',When I was a kid
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about God
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said 'God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves'
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth,I took a little faith
And put it in a parking lot
I drove to a strange town
Full of have and have nots
And as I walked through that storybook life
I was looking for an angel to chase the devil at the night

How does it feel to be human
If I could for one day I might just do it
Dance till the sun comes up to my music

A missing person's in the window
Staring at me,Haven't seen them in years
First things first
Second in command
Right as i'm trying to change my plan
Second gonna die,Oh he cant breathe,Everybody's staring straight at me
You spend it all chasing those lies,I dont really wanna take that chance
I dont really wanna do that dance
I dont know what to do till you say
Oh i dont wanna let you go
But i cant keep holding on
Skies of silver, Stars of gold
And now you know just what you like
So far this love is all i have
So far this hurt is all i have
Missing person at the window
Missing person at the window
A missing person at the window
Missing person at the window
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are
Wonder where you..."

Oh no... here we go now,Daddy thinks I'm lazy; he don't understand
Never saw inside my head
People think I'm crazy but I'm in demand
Never heard a thing I said
Momma's gonna worry

No use sayin' sorry
It's something that I enjoy

And with one pull of the trigger he would vanish overnight
Dancing by the roadside, holding on for dear life
Then a gun from out of nowhere made a widow of his wife,I don't mind
Single file down the runway
Feelin' fine,And I'll see you my friend
Over and over again,Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason again,Riding painted horses, oh, the kids, they love it so
You can see it on their faces, how they love the wind to blow
Minding my own business, like my mamma always said
But if I don't try to help 'em, they could wind up on the front page,I don't mind
Draw the line, then draw me an arrow

shorter as the far is now nearer,Are you just a mirror
standing in front of me?
Am i blind
can my eyes really see?,You may say i'm a miracle mannequin
Here i come with my mystical plan again
Although you think i can, i'm just a man
And i don't walk on water (oh no)
I don't walk on water (oh no)
I don't walk on water (oh no)
I don't walk on water (oh no),My dromedary dreams
as wet as oceans
With sand dunes bearing seeds
she set in motion
My dromedary dreams
My dromedary dreams
My dromedary dreams"

It's all timeless and never ending
To take it in it's all too vast
It goes - forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes
Tommorow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity
The time is coming but also going
And it's leaving never to return
Maybe forever it could be heaven
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn
It goes - forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes
Tommorow
I got to travel forever
It's all within my mind
An endless path to endeavour
But forever is a long long time
There's no secrets and no corruption
In the centre of infinity
There's no limits in non-existence
And no begining to my destiny
It goes - forever and ever
You thought you knew but you never
There goes
Tommorow
Journey to the centre of eternity
Journey to the centre of eternity
""so tired""
Time has come to say goodbye
I know it's gonna make you cry
But you belong to another my love
And half a love that just isn't enough
I am so tired
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tried
And I always thought we would see it through
I've waited all this time for you
Believed your promises were true
I keep believing that you mean what you say
You'll leave tommorow - now tommorow's today
And I often sit and wonder why
You're not with me tonight
I stayed at home remaining true
While you were out with you know ho
I am so tired
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tried
And I always thought we would see it through"

Blood running down like water
You'll think you got away
Until the judgment day comes,Are you ready?,Black rain, black rain
Black rain, black rain,War killing sons and daughters

Blood running down like water

Until the judgment day
You'll think you got away
Until your judgment day comes"

I haven't been there when you needed me
I didn't deserve the love you gave
But now I'm telling you
I'm here, if you need a friend,Give me your pain
Give me your anger
Let me be your rock
I can be the pillar of strength that you need
I help you keep it all together
It's better late than never
Lay your world on me
I can take the weight,Don't let it twist you up inside
Time never fails to make the heartache stop
You've gotta let those feelings go
I'll give you everything I can
If you say the word,Give me your pain
Give me your anger
Let me be your rock
I can be the pillar of strength that you need
I help you keep it all together
It's better late than never
Lay your world on me
I can take the weight,We all live and we all cry
We all hurt the same inside
We all fall down
Then we lose faith and who we really are
But if we bend instead of break
The choice for us is to make it together
Lay your world on me,I help you keep it all together
It's better late than never
Lay your world on me
Lay your world on me
Lay your world on me
I can take the weight"

May not have mattered
Take another point of view
Doubts will arise though
Like chasing a rainbow
I can tell a thing or two
That's true,You've got to believe in yourself
Or no one will believe in you
Imagination like a bird on the wing
Flying, free for you to use
OK baby,I can't believe they stop and stare
And point their fingers doubting me
Their disbelief suppresses them
But they're not blind
It's just that they won't see,I'm a believer, I ain't no deceiver
Mountains move before my eyes
Destiny planned out I don't need no handout
Speculation of the wise"

Going nowhere fast

What's all this commotion?
It leaves me mystified,Chasing all the rainbows
Falling from the sky
I know your intentions
Are all a bunch of lies
I'm running out of patience,
Falling off track
You better start to worry,
'Cause I may not make it back

One good reason to blow me away

Dying by the rail

Knockin' at the door
Or just another lightweight
Finally evening the score
