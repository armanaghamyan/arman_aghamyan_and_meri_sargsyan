And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain,I've lived a life that's full
I've travelled each and every highway
and more, much more than this
I did it my way,Regrets I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption,I planned each chartered course
Each careful step along the by-way
And more, much more than this
I did it my way,Yes, there were times
I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all,And I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed, and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing,And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way,""Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way""
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way"

that you despise the same old lies
you heard the night before.,And though it's just a line to you,
for me it's true,
it never seemed so right before.
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say,
to make the meaning come true.

Then if you go, I'll understand,
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand,
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
If you go, as I know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning
Till you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love without loving you,
Can I tell you now, as you turn to go, I'll be dying slowly till the next hello,
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
But if you stay, I'll make you a night
Like no night has been, or will be again.
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch,
I'll talk to your eyes that I love so much.
But if you go, go, I won't cry,
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye,
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
If you go away, as I know you must,
There'll be nothing left in the world to trust,
Just an empty room, full of empty space,
Like the empty look I see on your face.

Of things I can't forget
Journeys on a jet
Our wond'rous week in martinique
And vegas and roulette
How lucky I was,And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea
Dawn in waikiki
We had a pad in london
But we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was,Now since our breakup I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me,But thanks for the memory
Of every touch a thrill
I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot
You loved me not and still
I miss you so much,Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog
Even in a fog
That barbecue in malibu
Away from all the smog
How rainy it was,Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed
Books that we enjoyed
Tonight the way things look
I need a book by sigmund freud
How brainy he was,Gone are those evenings on broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the late show
And wish that you
Were watching, too,I know it's a fallacy
That grown men never cry
Baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses
But forgot that roses die
And thank you so much"

And life gets more exciting with each passing day.
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way.,Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth

I stand, and I wait

The roses are sighing
a moonlight serenade.,The stars are aglow,
and tonight, how their light sets me dreaming.
My love, do you know
that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you, and I sing you
a moonlight serenade.,Let us stay till break of day
in love's valley of dreams.
Just you and I, a summer sky,
a heavenly breeze, kiss in the trees.,So don't let me wait-
come to me tenderly in the June night.
I stand at your gate
and I sing you a song in the moonlight.
A love song, my darling-

Picture a tomboy in lace

Of an age the world has long forgotten,
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today.
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada.
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada.
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along,
Entranced by the beauty before me,
Entranced by a land full of flowers and song.
When day is done and the sun touch the sea in Granada,
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Tierra Novada,
Soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Carbinera.
Then moonlit Granada will live again,
The glory of yesterday, romantic and gay.

Mi cantar se vuelve gitano cuando es para ti
Mi cantar, hecho de fantasia
Mi cantar, flor de melancolia
Que yo te vengo a dar,Granada, Manola cantada en coplas preciosas
No tengo otra cosa que darte que un ramo de rosas
De sueño rebelde y gitano cubierta de flores
Y beso tu boca de grana jugosa manzana
Que me habla de amores,Granada, tierra ensangrentada en tardes de toros
Mujer que conserva el embrujo de tus ojos moros
De rosas de suave fragancia
Que le dieran marco a la Virgen morena,Granada, tu tierra esta llena
De lindas mujeres, de sangre y de sol,De rosas de suave fragancia

Get my slippers

Mmm, you were very good,I still look up
When you walk in the room
I've the same wide eyes
Now they tell a story,I try not to reach out
When you turn around
You say hello
And we both pretend
No great pretender,So I close my eyes softly
'Til i become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime,And to those that I love
Like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel
Angel of my dreams,Angel of my dreams,I still look up,I try hard not to look up
Ooh, yeah,That girl was me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,Track a ghost through the fog
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,A charmed hour and a haunted song,Track a ghost through the fog, baby,Ooh, you try hard
But you'll never catch me
Yeah"

The end of the light
She remains of all of her foes
Miranda is dying with all of her might
She never comes
She always goes,She sticks the camera right into her arm
Anything to forget what the trouble's about
It causes her pain
That's part of the charm
She's down for the count
And finally out,Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes miranda
And miranda is always alone,She sees her face in another magazine
And the walls all close in
As the fancy takes flight
Can't stand to be loved
But she loves to be seen
She slips headlong into the night,Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes miranda
And miranda is always alone,And then all at once
The sun starts to rise
She sees her father holding her down
All the daylight is poison to her eyes
She slips down the shade
And lets herself drown,Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes miranda
And miranda is always alone,The lights shot down in the arena
All across the safety zone
Loneliness follows miranda
And miranda is always alone
Miranda is always alone
Miranda is always alone"

It's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining what your imagination
Can make you see and feel,Seems like a dream
(They) got me hypnotized,Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North
Carolina and a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed,Seems like a dream
(They) got me hypnotized,They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if those stories are right
'Cause what matters most if the feeling
You get when you're hypnotized,Seems like a dream

Nobody seems to know just what it is
And the airforce won't let on
It might be hole down in the ocean
Yeah or a fog that won't let go
It might be some crazy people talking
Or somebody that we ought to know

Way down in the triangle, it's easy to believe,Now here's one
You see strange shapes in moonlight
And shadows in the night
They said that wingtip seemed to brush their faces
And strangers stole their sight
Way down in the triangle
Where the sea was smooth as glass

That you never thought you'd ask

They came from New Orleans
And then from Bloomington, and Delaware
The used St. Petersburg, they came from Tampa
And then from Mexico, it doesn't matter where
They all completely share,
All of those ships and planes,
A great big mystery that cannot be explained,
Down in Bermuda, in the pale blue sea,Your feeling safe in your harbour
And everything seems certain
Right next to Palm Beach and Key Biscane
Behind a velvet curtain
But then the moon goes grey with worry
And the sea turns a pale white

Love shines, love shines so bright

On and on it will always be

Drove me like a magnet,To the sea

Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon
And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me,And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love, nor money
I think she knew
Well, the people they still love her
And still they are the most cruel
She asked me
Be my sister, sister, sister of the moon,Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
They like to wrap her in velvet
Does anyone, ooo... know her name"

And from the land
Or floating by, a fisherman's day,Flying down from a high

Everlong.
Tonight,
I throw myself into,
And out of the red, out of her head she sang.,Come down
And waste away with me,
Down with me...
Slow how,
You wanted it to be,
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang.,And I wonder when I sing along with you,
If everything could ever feel this real forever.
If anything could ever be this good again,
The only thing I'll ever ask of you.
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when.
She sang:,Breathe out,
So I can breathe you in,
Hold you in,
And now,
I know you've always been there

Where do I begin?,I'm learning to talk again

Set me free again
You keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice but knowing to survive
The first to climb another state of mind

I never wanna die
I never wanna die
I never wanna die
I'm on my knees
I never wanna die
I'm dancing on my grave
I'm running through the fire

I never wanna die
I never wanna leave
I never say goodbye

Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most

Another one to deceive

To raise another in its place,A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged

No stranger singin' in your name,But maybe the season

No king or queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates,I know a wall to scale
I know a field without a name
Head on without a care

Forever gone without a trace

No turnin' back, don't turn that page,Come now, I'm leaving here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind

And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind,She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind,Aaaahhhh! Nikki! Oh...,The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind,Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind,Ahhhh! Nikki! Oh...

Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

Let me fall apart
Crippled in your arms,Chase me through the dark
Ready on your mark
First to reach the stars
Wins a broken heart
One that broke apart
Shattered from the start,Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore,Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon,Could I be the one
To break a will so strong
Pray it won't be long
Til your will is gone
Everything is done
Nothing left at all,Are you there?

Life belonged to runaways
Nothing here to see
No looking back,Every sound monotone
Every color monochrome
Life began to fade into the black,Such a simple animal
Sterilized with alcohol
I could hardly feel me anymore,Desperate and meaningless
All filled up with emptiness
Felt like everything was said and done,I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive,Still I tried to find my way
Spinning hours into days
Burning like a flame behind my eyes,Drown it out
Drink it in
Crown the king of suffering
Prisoner; a slave to the disguise,Disappear the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering
Knew that it was time to say goodbye,I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive,No reason left me to survive
You saved me the day you came alive,Come alive
Come alive...
I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive,Come alive
Come alive...
Nothing more to give
I can finally live
Come alive,You're not killing me
I can finally breathe
Come alive,I lay there in the dark
Open my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive,Come alive
Come alive,

You drink the night away

This city's dance makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taken you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything,Used to think that it was so easy
Used to say that it was so easy
But you're trying, you're trying now,Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're crying, you're crying now,Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
And he asks where you've been
You tell him who you've seen
And you talk about everything
He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down
In this quiet little town
And forget about everything,But you know he'll always keep moving
You know, he's never gonna stop moving
'Cause he's rolling, he's a rolling stone,When you wake up, it's a new morning
The sun is shining, it's a new morning

Whose reality, I knew,
Was a hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope
Began its downward slope
And I believed for a moment that
My chances were
Approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near,
So did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird,
But it was just a paper bag,Hunger hurts,
And I want him so bad, oh it kills

I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts but starvin' works
When it costs too much to love,And I went crazy again today
Looking for a strand to climb
Looking for a little hope
Baby said he couldn't stay
Wouldn't put his lips to mine
A fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said, ""Honey, I don't feel so good,
Don't feel justified.
Come on put a little love here in my void""
He said ""It's all in your head""
And I said ""So's everything""

It's color's richness won't appear within your view
I'll never glow the way that you glow
Your presence dominates the judgements made on you,But as the scenery grows I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater heights
I understand what I am still too proud to mention... to you
You'll say you understand, but you don't understand
You'll say you'll never give up seeing eye to eye
But never is a promise, and you can't afford to lie,You'll never touch these things that I hold
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own You'll never feel the heat of this soul
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown... to you,You'll say don't fear your dreams, it's easier than it seems
You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high
But never is a promise and you can't afford to lie,You'll never live this life that I live
I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night
You'll never hear the message I give
You'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight ...,But as the scenery grows I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater heights
I realize what I am now too smart to mention... to you,You'll say you understand; you'll never understand
I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why
I don't know what to believe in; you don't know who I am
You'll say I'll need appeasing when I start to cry

You won't go, but I know
And I pray that you will,Fast as you can
Baby run, free yourself of me
Fast as you can,I may be soft in your palm
But I'll soon grow hungry for a fight
And I will not let you win
My pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will
Disprove your faith in man
So if you catch me trying to find my way into your
Heart from under your skin,Fast as you can
Baby scratch me out, free yourself
Fast as you can
Fast as you can
Baby scratch me out, free yourself
Fast as you can,Sometimes my mind don't shake and shift
But most of the time, it does
And I get to the place where I'm begging for a lift
Or I'll drown in the wonders and the was
And I'll be your girl if you say it's a gift
And you give me some more of your drugs
Yeah, I'll be your pet if you just tell me it's a gift
Cause I'm tired of whys choking on whys,
Just need a little because because,I let the beast in and then
I even tried forgiving him but it's too soon
So I'll fight again, again, again, again, again
And for a little while more
I'll soar the uneven wind
Complain and blame the sterile land
But if you're getting any bright ideas, quiet dear
I'm blooming within,Fast as you can
Baby wait watch me, I'll be out
Fast as I can
Maybe late but at least about
Fast as you can
Leave me, let this thing run its route,Fast as you can... (4x)"

Of little wings of white-flamed
Butterflies in my brain

Percolate the mind
Trickle down the spine
Swarm the belly, swelling to a blaze
That's where the pain comes in
Like a second skeleton
Trying to fit beneath the skin
I can't fit the feelings in
Every single night's alight with my brain,What'd I say to her?
Why'd I say to her?
What does she think of me?
That I'm not what I ought to be
That I'm what I try not to be
It's got to be somebody else's fault
I can't get caught
If what I am is what I am, 'cause I does what I does
Then brother, get back, 'cause my breast's gonna bust open
The rib is the shell and the heart is the yolk
I just made a meal for us both to choke on
Every single night's a fight with my brain,I just want to feel everything
I just want to feel everything
I just want to feel everything,So I'm gonna try to be still now
Gonna renounce the mill a little while and
If we had a double-king-sized bed
We could move in it and I'd soon forget
That what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does
And maybe I'd relax, let my breast just bust open
My heart's made of parts of all that surround me
And that's why the devil just can't get around me

And every single fight's alright with my brain,I just want to feel everything

And if it gets too late, for me to wait
For you to find you love me, and tell me so

I sent it via pantomime
While you were watchin' someone else
I stared at you and cut myself,It's all I'll do 'cause I'm not free
A fugitive too dull too flee
I'm amorous but out of reach
A still life drawing of a peach,I'm a tulip in a cup
I stand no chance of growing up
I've made my peace I'm dead, I'm done
I watched you live to have my fun,I root for you, I love you
You, you, you
I root for you, I love you
You, you, you,I made it to a dinner date
My teardrops seasoned every plate
I tried to dance but lost my nerve
I cramped up in the learning curve,I'm a tulip in a cup

I'm resigned to sail on through

And
I certainly haven't been spreading myself around

I can't stop changing all the time,I notice that my opponent is always on the go
And
Won't go slow, so's not to focus, and I notice
He'll hitch a ride with any guide
As long as they go fast from whence he came
But he's no good at being uncomfortable, so
He can't stop staying exactly the same,If there was a better way to go then it would find me

You deem me due to clean my view and be at piece and lay
I mean to prove I mean to move in my own way, and say
I've been getting along for long before you came into the play,I am the baby of the family, it happens, so
Everybody cares and wears the sheep's clothes while they chaperon
Curious you looking down your nose at me
While you appease courteous to try and help
But let me set your mind at ease,If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me

I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine,Do I so worry you,
You need to hurry to my side?
It's very kind
But it's to no avail
And I don't want the bail
I promise you, everything will be just fine,If there was a better way to go then it would find me

And sank in the burrows of my keep,And all my armor falling down, in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm, as I'm singing him to sleep,He goes along just as a water lily
Gentle on the surface of his thoughts his body floats
Unweighted down by passion or intensity
Yet unaware of the depth upon which he coasts
And he finds a home in me
For what misfortune sows, he knows my touch will reap,And all my armor failing down, in a pile at my feet

And why men buy them
What's so impressive about a diamond
Except the mining
But it's dangerous work

And I think if I didn't have to kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill myself doing it
Maybe I wouldn't think so much of you,I've been watching all the time

Is it just fine
Or is it my fault
Is it my lack,I don't understand about
The weather outside
Or the harmony in a tune
Or why somebody lied
But there's solace a bit in submitting
To the fitfully, cryptically true
What's happened, has happened
What's coming is already on its way
With a role for me to play
And I don't understand
I never understand

Now when you look at me, you're condemned to see
The monster your mother made you to be
And there ya got me, that's how you got free, you got rid of me,I ran out of white dove feathers
To soak up the hot piss that comes through your mouth
Every time you address me,I ran out of white dove feathers
To soak up the hot piss that comes through your mouth
Every time you address me
Alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone

I certainly haven't been spreading myself around
I still only travel by foot and by foot, it's a slow climb,
But I'm good at being uncomfortable, so
I can't stop changing all the time,I notice that my opponent is always on the go
-And-
Won't go slow, so's not to focus, and I notice
He'll hitch a ride with any guide, as long as
They go fast from whence he came
- But he's no good at being uncomfortable, so
He can't stop staying exactly the same,If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine,I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day
You deem me due to clean my view and be at piece and lay
I mean to prove I mean to move in my own way, and say,
I've been getting along for long before you came into the play,I am the baby of the family, it happens, so
- Everybody cares and wears the sheeps' clothes
While they chaperone
Curious, you looking down your nose at me, while you appease
- Courteous, to try and help - but let me set your
Mind at ease,(Chorus),-Do I so worry you, you need to hurry to my side?
-It's very kind
But it's to no avail; I don't want the bail
I promise you, everything will be just fine,If there was a better way to go then it would find me

Before the image that you burned me in
Tries to teach you a lesson,What you did to me made me see myself somethin' awful
A voice once stentorian is now again meek and muffled
It took me such a long time to get back up the first time you did it
I spent all I had to get it back, and now it seems I've been outbidded,My peace and quiet was stolen from me
When I was looking with calm affection
You were searching out my imperfections,What wasted unconditional love
On somebody
Who doesn't believe in the stuff,You came upon me like a hypnic jerk
When I was just about to settle
And when it counts you recoil
With the cryptic word and leave a love belittled,Oh what a cold and common old way to go
I was feeding on the need for you to know me
Devastated at the rate you fell below me,What wasted unconditional love

Don't even show me your face, cause it's a crying shame

Take the sorrow you gave and all the stakes you claim

Now before I melt away"",Down to the village

Smile at them and bat my eyes.
Press against them when we dance,
Make them think they stand a chance,
Then refuse to see it through.
That's a thing I'd never do.,I could stay home every night,
Wait around for Mr. Right.
Take cold showers every day,
And throw my life away,
On a dream that won't come true.,I could hurt someone like me,
Out of spite or jealousy.
I dont steal and I dont lie,
But I can feel and I can cry.
A fact I'll bet you never knew.

Can't even get a trade in on your smock!,Angels: (la lalala lalala lalala...),Beauty school dropout,
No graduation day for you.
Beauty school dropout,
Missed your midterms and flunked shampoo!
Well at least you could have taken time, to wash and clean
your clothes up,
After spending all that dough to have the doctor fix your nose
up!,Baby get moving (Baby get movin),
Why keep your feeble hopes alive?
What are you proving (What are you provin)?
You've got the dream but not the drive.,If you go for your diploma, you could join a steno pool.
Turn in your teasin comb and go back to high school!,Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout),
Hanging around the corner store.
Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout),
It's about time you knew the score.,Well they couldn't teach you anything,
You think you're such a looker,
But no customer would go to you unless she was a hooker!,Baby don't sweat it (Don't sweat it),
You're not cut out to hold a job.
Better forget it (Forget it),
Who wants their hair done by a slob?,Now your bangs are curled, your lashes twirled, but still the
world is cruel.
Wipe off that angel face and go back to high school!,Baby don't blow it,
Don't put my good advice to shame.
Baby you know it,
Even Dear Abby'd say the same!,Now I've called the shot, get off the pot, I really gotta
fly!
Gotta be going to that, malt shop, in the sky!,Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
Go back to high school
Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
Go back to high school
Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
Go back to high school"

And I will be wearing your lacy lingerie
Thinking about it, my heart's pounding already
Knowing when you come home, we're bound to go steady

And my circulation cries; 'condition red'
I'm in a cold sweat, my t-shirt's all wet

My knees are weak, and my back bone breaks,
My hands are colder than ice, my throat is locked in a vice,
Come on and change my pain to pa-a-ra-a-dise.,Well there's a fever heat runnin' through my skin
Don't you hear me knockin', won't ya let me in?
You know I'm your fool, So don't you be cruel,

It's a situation I know pretty well,
Well, I been there too, So I feel for you.
Uh-huh, I'm all choked up,Girls: And further more:,Sandy:
So you're down and out, and you're against the wall,
And you say that I'm the one that did it all,
I'm sure you're sincere, It gets me right here,
Uh-huh, I'm all choked up.,Oh baby, take my heart and don't complain,
My poor heart just can't stand the strain,
I can cure your disease, Come on and say pretty please,
Take your medicine down on your knees.,Danny:
I got a fever: a hundred-four fahrenheit,
I need your lovin', can i come over tonight?
Feelin' low down, my equilibrium's shot,
Give me, the tranquilizer you got.,Well baby take my ring, 'cause you're my match.,Sandy:
Well, I still think there's strings attached,,Danny:
You're writin' my epitaph,,Sandy:
Well, that's just tough and a half.,Danny:
You're gonna make me die,,Sandy:
Don't make me laugh.,Danny and Sandy:
Well, I'll forgive for what you put me through,
'cause I do believe you really love me too.

But his need for it controls him
And her back's against the wall,And it's So long girl, I'll see you
When it's time for him to go,You know the woman wants her cowboy
Like he wants his rodeo
Well, it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps,It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins,And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo
It'll drive a cowboy crazy
It'll drive a man insane,And he'll sell off everything he owns
Just to pay to play her game
And a broken home and some broken bones
Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin'
This dream they call rodeo
Well, it's bulls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo
It's the broncs and the blood
It's the steers and the mud
And they call the thing rodeo"

I'll do anything you want me to
I'll do anything at all,And I'm standing here for all the world to see
Oh baby that's what's left of me
Don't have very far to fall,You know now I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been livin' in
I don't break easy I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied,I'm shameless, oh honey I don't have a prayer
Every time I see you standin' there
I go down upon my knees,And I'm changin' swore I'd never compromise
Oh but you convinced me otherwise
I'll do anything you please,You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist what I couldn't turn down
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you,I have never let anything have this much control over me
I work too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
But it's your world now I can't refuse
I've never had so much to lose
Oh I'm shameless,You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I've ever missed
But I've never been in love like this,It's out of my hands
I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
I don't want it anyhow
So I got to let it go,Oh I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be
You make a total fool of me
I just wanted to you to know,Oh I'm shameless
I just wanted you to know
Oh I'm shameless
Oh I'm down on my knees... shameless"

Momma's on the front porch screamin' out her warning

And where it's George Strait 'til real late
And dancing cheek to cheek

Midnight starts the hard romancing
One o'clock that truck is rocking
Two is coming, still no stopping
Break to check the clock at three
They're right on where they want to be
Four o'clock get up and going
Five o'clock that rooster's crowing

Six o'clock on Saturday
Her folks don't know he's on his way
The stalls are clean, the horses fed
They say she's grounded 'til she's dead
Well here he comes around the bend
Slowing down, she's jumping in
Hey mom, you're daughter's gone
And there they go again

And that Copenhagen smile

We were much too young, havin' too much fun
As we all sang along,We sang Life's a Highway

Pull your hat down tight

And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride,From gold buckles to gold records
Once again he was spinnin' 'round
Took the whole world on
And he turned us on to that Western Underground
And from Bareback Jack to This Cowboy's Hat
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down from town to town
Like children running thru the rain,We sang Life's a Highway

We're playin' for fun, but we're playin' for keeps,So draw the curtain, honey
Turn the lights down low

And I don't recall no dance hall girls
Or hotel rooms with rugs
You worked hot and tired and nasty
Rode your pony's head too low
There were all the nights you couldn't sleep
'Cause it was too damn cold
And you'd sing Strawberry Roan and Little Joe,Like the time we hit the river
And the rains began to fall
And the water was risin' so damn fast
We thought it'd drown us all,We lost a lot of steers that day
And four to five good mounts
But when all the boys rode into camp
We knew that's what counts
And we sang, yippie ti yi yay and Amazing Grace,Or the night they broke behind us
And then took us by surprise
I whistled out to Bonner, I seen the terror in his eyes
And he rode for all his horse would ride
And I know he done his best
But he crossed over Jordan ridin' Dunny to his death
And we sang Bringing in the Sheep and The Rugged Cross,So when you see the cowboy, he's not ragged by his choice
He never meant to bow them legs
Or put that gravel in his voice
He's just chasin' what he really loves
And what's burnin' in his soul
Wishin' to God that he'd been born a hundred years ago
Still singin' Strawberry Roan and Little Joe"

Pouring it's light out across the water
For this sinking soul to see
That someone out there still believes in me.,Chorus:
On a prayer, in a song, I hear your voice, and it keeps me hanging on, on.
Raining down, against the wind,
I'm reaching out till we reach the circle's end, when you come back to me again.,There's a moment that we all come to
In our own time, and our own space where all that we've done we can undo
If our heart's in the right place

Unfolding like a mystery
You're changing all that is and use to be,(repeat chorus)

And all us kids listened
About his life on the border
And the way it was then
And we'd all believe
And when he was finished
We'd ask the old cowboy
To tell them again,You could almost hear
Those prairie winds blowin'
His saddle a creaking
'Neath his old faded jeans
You could taste the dry dust
From the trail he was ridin,
As he sat there and painted
Those west Texas scenes,And the grownups would tell us, ""You boys keep your distance""
""That old man's just telling you lies""
But to all us kids
Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true
As his blue Texas skies.,He told of the time
When he rode with the Rangers
Down on the Pecos
And he saved the day
Outnumbered by plenty
They were almost to cover
With 30 banditos
Headed their way,He looked back just in time
To see a horse stumble
The captain went down
And Bill pulled up on his reins
And through a flurry of bullets
He rescued the captain
They rode for a sunset
Just the story remains,And the grownups would tell us, ""You boys keep your distance""
""That old man's just telling you lies""
But to all us kids
Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true
As his blue Texas skies.,Well I still remember
The day that it happened
We waited and we waited
But Bill never showed
The folks at the feed store
Said that they hadn't seen him
So we set out for his place
Down old Christville road,And we cried when we found him
Lying there with his memories
The old trunk wide open
Things scattered about
He was clutching a badge
That said, ""Texas Ranger""
And in old yeller letters
Said, ""Texas Is Proud"",And those grownups that told us, ""You boys keep your distance""
That old man's just tellin you lies""
Well now
They're all saying
That Cowboy Bill was a hero
Just as true
As his blue Texas skies,Just as true

Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was travelling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand,She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time,Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolks brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense
And perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring,She waited till just before midnight
So no one would see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him,Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door and let me see
Though she trembled, she did as He asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring up into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new,Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king,Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offerings was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song"

(Yeaaaaaaaieee)
(Look Out),Twenty five minutes past quittin' time
Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
Payin' no attention to them highway signs
Doing 90 miles an hour towards the county line
Quick sack, twelve pack, back again
It's a b-double-e-double-r-u-n.,Our buddies and their babies letting down their hair
As long as we're together it don't matter where
Ain't got a lot of money, but we just don't care
Knowing half the fun is in the getting there
Aztec, long necks, paychecks spent
Oohh, it's a b-double-e-double-r-u-n.,I can't stop thinking
what the hell they were drinkin
When they made this county dry
I got a week long thirst, and to make it worse
Lord, it's my turn to drive,Laughin, and bragging, and a carrying on
We loaded up the wagons and we headed home
I guess half a dozen cases doesn't last that long
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone
Then, it's turn around, leave town, sounds again
Like a b-double-e-double-r-u-n.
Heeeyy, like a b-double-e-double-r-u-n.,(Hey)

To the Gulf of Mexico
Everyday I'd see this fellow
With his tackle box and pole
And he'd fish
And he'd fish
All day long,So one day I went out walking
And when I got down to his spot
Me and him got to talking
And said have you ever thought
About what you are going to do with your life
I said I'm about to share with you
My secret to success
So you can go make something of yourself,You can sell these fish you're catching
You can buy yourself a boat
Hard work and dedication
And the next thing you know
You reinvest your money
You'll be captain of the fleet
You'll be sitting pretty down on Easy Street
And you can do anything that you wish
He says, you mean fish?,His simple words of wisdom
Hit me right between the eyes
And it really got me thinking
About the way I live my life
Cause I just work
And I work
All day long,So I asked myself a question
That I knew the answer to
Is success a second mortgage
On a big house with a pool
Or is it a chair
The salt in the air
Wetting the line,That advice that I tried to give him
To take him to the top
Was really nothing more than just a crock,You can sell these fish you're catching
You can buy yourself a boat
Hard work and dedication
And the next thing you know
You reinvest your money
You'll be captain of the fleet
You'll be sitting pretty down on Easy Street
And you can do anything that you wish
He says, you mean fish?,So I went and bought some tackle
And a bucket full of bait
You can find me here most days
With my chair sitting there next to his
We just fish
Yeah, we just fish
Yeah fish, fish, fish, fish, fish"

The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farmin'
So he slipped away one night 'neath the harvest moon,His neck was red as Alabama clay
But the city's call pulled him away
He's got a factory job and runs a big machine
He don't miss the farm or the fields of green,Now the city's just a prison without fences
His job is just a routine he can't stand
And at night he dreams of wide-open spaces
Fresh dirt between his toes and on his hands,Then one day a picture came inside a letter
Of a young girl with a baby in her arms
And the words she wrote would change his life forever
So he went to raise his family on the farm,His neck is red as Alabama clay
Now he's goin' home this time to stay
Where the roots run deep on the family tree
And the tractor rolls through the fields of green,His neck is red as Alabama clay

His grip on the gospel

And he ain't bathed in weeks

Shows up on his cheeks,He looks like a scarecrow
A sight to behold
As he works for the shepherd

Can save any man,Son, it aint what you're driving

Will be fit for a king,He's fighting a fever
In spite of the chill

And he speaks of God's will,His body is weakened
But his faith is still strong
For he's filled with conviction
For the mission he's on,He knows soon in heaven
He'll be homeless no more
As his work will soon echo
From that dar distant shore,Son, it aint what you're driving

Won't matter up there,And someday in heaven

And it scared me so much
That I just wouldn't budge
I might have stayed there forever

You move me

There can be no sorrow
Right here where we stand
And living only for this moment,All we've ever wanted
Is right here in our hands
And some will say that we're sure to fall
Try and build their walls between us,No way over it
No way around it
If we want it
We have to go through it,Fight for a love
And the world tries to break us down
But the world will bend and the fight will end
Love will always win,Hold on till we see tomorrow
There is time to borrow
Till we own our own
Walk on and our hearts will lead us,But our hearts will need us
To be steady and strong
So we can stand and face the fire
Burning higher and higher,No way over it
No way around it
If we want it
We have to go through it,Fight for a love
And the world tries to break us down
But the world will bend and the fight will end
Love will always win,No, we know that a rainbow ends
Beyond dark skies,No way over it
No way around it, no
If we want it
We have to go through it,Fight for a love
And the world tries to break us down
But the world will bend and the fight will end
And the world will bend and the fight will end
Love will always win"

Guess I ain't too diplomatic
I just never been the kind to go along
Just avoidin' confrontation
For the sake of conformation
And I'll admit I tend to sing a different song
But sometimes you just can't be afraid
To wear a different hat
If Columbus had complied
This old world might still be flat
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain,Well, I have been accused
Of makin' my own rules
There must be rebel blood
Just a-runnin' through my veins
But I ain't no hypocrite
What you see is what you get
And that's the only way I know
To play the game
Old Noah took much ridicule
For building his great ark
But after forty days and forty nights
He was lookin' pretty smart
Sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain
By havin' strength to go against the grain,Well, there's more folks than a few
Who share my point of view
But they're worried
If they're gonna sink or swim
They'd like to buck the system
But the deck is stacked against 'em
And they're a little scared
To go out on a limb
But if you're gonna make a difference
If you're gonna leave your mark
You can't follow like a bunch of sheep
You got to listen to your heart
Go bustin' in like old John Wayne
Sometimes you got to go against the grain,Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain"

Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold,She ran his weary heart through the ringer
And she wore him like the diamond ring around her finger
Well, his advances and affections, she managed to avoid
But, she got the lap of luxury and he got paranoid,And he said, do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold,
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul
Or are you just digging for gold, digging for gold,Big house, limousines,
Fine wines, fine cuisines,
Vale and Vegas twice a year,
Trips to Paris on the leer,Black Tuesday when that wall of wealth came crashing down
Bad news day when that little queen had to give back her crown
And he said, hey babe, we can live on love 'cause love is worth much more
But he barely got his feelings out, she was half way to the door
And she never even heard him cry,Do you love me, baby, do you want me to hold
Or are you just digging for gold
Do you care enough to give me your heart and soul

Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I,When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul,Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins,One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I,Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone,When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins,One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky,One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I"

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday,Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line
To find the money's on the other side,Can I get another amen?
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument,I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday,Three, four
The representative from California has the floor,""Sieg Heil"" to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government,""Bang, bang"" goes the broken glass and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me,Just 'cause
Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah,I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies

The bible of none of the above
On a steady diet of
Soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my sins in hell
As far as I can tell
At least the ones I got away with,And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me,Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room or my private womb
While the Mom's and Brad's are away,To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine,And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me,At the center of the Earth in the parking lot
Of the 7-11 where I was taught,The motto was just a lie
It says home is where your heart is, but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time,City of the dead (Hey, hey)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey, hey)
Signs misleading to nowhere,City of the damned (Hey, hey)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey, hey)

Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess,It didn't say much but it only confirmed that
The center of the earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less,City of the dead (Hey, hey)

Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved

From Anaheim to the middle east
We are the stories and disciples of

Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse,Uuh,To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe,And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies,I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the lights of masochists,And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times,But not this time!,I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize

Running away from pain when you've been victimized

They hate if you're clever and despise a fool

When you can't really function, you're so full of fear,A working class hero is something to be

And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still peasants as far as I can see,A working class hero is something to be

But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like all the folks on the hill

A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled

Born on the 4th of July
Raised in the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive,I am a nation, a worker of pride
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands and the means to an end
Is all that I have to show,I swallowed my pride and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control,I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet
Of flowers left over from the grave
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for Judgment Day,I praise liberty, the ""freedom to obey""
Is the song that strangles me?
Well, don't cross the line,Oh, dream, America, dream
I can't even sleep from the light's early dawn
Oh, scream, America, scream

In the states of mind is my own private suicide,Well, nobody cares
Well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well, nobody cares
Well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well, nobody cares
Well, nobody cares,Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on east 12th Street
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety now
'Cuz she had enough and he had plenty,Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here,So far away, I don't want to stay
Get me outta here right now
I just want to be free, is there a possibility?
Get me out of here right now
Right!
This life like dream ain't for me,I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After 10 cups of coffee and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song but something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone 'cuz no one's here
Left me here alone and I should've stayed home
After 10 cups of coffee, I'm thinking,(Where'd you go?)
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
(Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Havin' fun,(Where'd you go?)
Everyone left you
Nobody likes you
(Where'd you go?)
They're all out without you
Havin' fun
(Where'd you go, go, go, go?),Geez
I got a rock' n' roll band
I got a rock 'n' roll life
I got a rock 'n' roll girlfriend
And another ex-wife,I got a rock 'n' roll house
I got a rock 'n' roll car
I play the shit out the drums
And I can play the guitar,I got a kid in New York
I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin' in over 22 days
So get off of my case, off of my case
Off of my case,Here they come marching down the street
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feets,There time has come and it's going nowhere
Nobody ever said that life was fair now
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat,The world is spinning round and round out of control again
The 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letter bomb and visit me in Hell
We're the ones going,Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again,I started fuckin' running
As soon as my feet touch ground
We're back in the barrio
And to you and me, that's Jingle town,Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again
Home
We're coming home again

We're coming home again

We're coming home again

We're coming home again
We're coming home again

We're coming home again

Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone,Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-,I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk a-,My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

I threw my crutches in the river of a shadow of doubt
And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best,Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain't this uniform so flattering?
I never asked you a God damned thing!,A fire burns today

Protest me, you will disappear,I want to know who's allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
Missionary politicians
And the cops of the new religion!,A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide

King of the forty thieves, I'm here to represent

With an angel face and a taste for suicidal,Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope

Raised in the city in a halo of lights
Product of war and fear that we've been victimized,I'm the patron saint of the denial

I'm a teenage assassin executing some fun
In the cult of the life of crime (St. Jimmy),I really hate to say it but I told you so
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down old boy (St. Jimmy)

As the years will testify

We're going to start a war

In graffiti on the walls
Falling through broken glass that's
Slashing though your spirit
I can hear it like a jilted crowd.,Gloria, where are you Gloria?
You found a home
In all your scars and ammunition
You made your bed in salad days
Amongst the ruin
Ashes to ashes of our youth
She mashed her knuckles into winter(Gloria)
As autumns wind fades into black
She is the saint on all the sinners(Gloria)
The one that's fallen through the cracks

Don't lose your faith
To your lost naivete
Weather the storm and don't look
Back on last November
When your banners were burning down,Gloria, ¡viva la Gloria!
Send me your amnesty down
To the broken hearted
Bring us the season
That we always will remember
Don't let the bonfires go out
So Gloria
Send out your message of the light
That shadows in the light.
Gloria, where's your undying love?
Tell me the story of your life

Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet,The time has come and it's going nowhere

Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear
In the summer heat,The world is spinning round and round
Out of control again
From the seven-eleven to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letter bomb and visit me in hell

The Jesus of Suburbia
The bible of none of the above
On a steady diet of
Soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my sins in hell
As far as I can tell
At least the ones I got away with,And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me,Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room or my private womb
While the Mom's and Brad's are away,To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine,And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me,At the center of the Earth in the parking lot
Of the 7-11 where I was taught,The motto was just a lie
It says home is where your heart is, but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time,City of the dead (Hey, hey)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey, hey)
Signs misleading to nowhere,City of the damned (Hey, hey)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey, hey)
No one really seems to care,I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess,It didn't say much but it only confirmed that
The center of the earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less,City of the dead (Hey, hey)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey, hey)
Signs misleading to nowhere,City of the damned (Hey, hey)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey, hey)
No one really seems to care (Hey),I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care,I don't care if you don't

I don't care if you don't care,I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care,I don't care,Everyone is so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave,We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the middle east
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia,Land of make believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make believe
And it don't believe,And I don't care! (Uh, uh, uh)
I don't care! (Uh, uh, uh)
I don't care! (Uh, uh, uh)

I can't remember a word that you were saying...
Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure,Uuh,Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse,Uuh,To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe,And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies,I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the lights of masochists,And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times,But not this time!,I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home
(Hoooommmee),You're leaving...
You're leaving...
You're leaving...
Ah, you're leaving home..."

I'll stand here and remember just how good its been
and I know I'll never love this way again,I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
And I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on

Hold on,I know I'll never love this way again So i keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on

We held each other tight
And tears fell from my eyes
As you walked and left me here
Like the wind you passed me by
I try but I can't see
If it's something that I said
Baby please won't you tell me now

That you'd come back and stay
We've had too much together
To ever live a part
I'll wait and see

Someday you'll come to realize

We'll held each other tight
Kiss the tears that burn my eyes

Of more worth than gold,So refine me, Lord, through the flame

Pero sabi mo
Sandali na lang,At nandito na
At ang panahon
Ay wala sa ating kamay
Huwag mag-alala
Maraming oras pa
Ang nakalaan
Para sa ating dal'wa
Naiinip, nasasabik, kasing bilis
Nang isang iglap mahahanap
Sa may ulap
Nagtatanong, nagtataka
Bat wala ka pa?

In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star
A signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises so will I,God of Your promise

Follow the sound of Your voice,And as You speak

Evolving in pursuit of what You said

If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high so will I
If the wind goes where You send it so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times,God of salvation

Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die,And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender so will I
I can see Your heart
Eight billion different ways
Every precious one
A child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I,Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind"

Lift up your eyes & see

They bruised and they mocked him,thorns in Crown round his head

And though it broke my heart, I won't complain

And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

Walk slowly down that long long path for soon I'll follow you

the love we shared is now a memory.
i had built a ship of dreams
and planned them all for you,
and now,
i guess,
what is to be will be.,i`ll sail my ship alone
with all the dreams i own,
drifting out across the ocean blue.
i`ll sail my ship alone,
though all the sails you`ve torn,
and when it starts to sink
then i`ll blame you.,i`m just like a ship at sea
that`s lost without a sail,
the dark clouds hide the sun from up above.
and even with these broken dreams
my heart will never fail,
for deep inside there`s only one true love.,i`ll sail my ship alone
with all the dreams i own,
drifting out across the ocean blue.
i`ll sail my ship alone,
though all the sails you`ve torn,
and when it starts to sink
then i`ll blame you.,gave a message to the wind
to take back home to you,
hoping you would hear my s.o.s.
maybe you would come back home,
my darling,
if you knew how much my aching heart
is in distress.,i`ll sail my ship alone
with all the dreams i own,
drifting out across the ocean blue.
i`ll sail my ship alone,

You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be when they come passing by
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts
You've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies
Some were propers some were kings and some were masters of the arts
But in their shame they're all the same these men with broken hearts
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath
So help your brother along the road no matter where he starts
For the God that made you made them too these men with broken hearts"

tonight we're having fun
We'll show the folks a brand new dance,

I don't care who thinks we're silly
you'll be daffy I'll be dilly
We'll order up two bowls of chili
settin' the woods on fire,I'll gas up my hot rod stoker
we'll get hotter than a poker
You'll be broke but I'll be broker tonight
we're settin' the woods on fire,We'll sit close to one another
up our street and down the other
Tonight we'll have ball oh brother
settin' the woods on fire,We'll put aside a little time to fix a flat or two
My trey and tubes are doin' fine but the air is showin' through
You clap hands and I'll start howlin'
we'll do all the law's allowin'
Tomorrow I'll be right back plowin'

When slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn
My sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew
'Til I found myself environed in a little colored pew,Out front a colored couple sat in sorrow nearly wild
On the altar was a casket and in the casket was a child
I could picture him while living, curly hair protruding lips
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips,Then rose a sad, old colored preacher from his little wooden desk
With a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque
The simplicity and shrewdness in his Ethiopian face
Showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed, undying race,And he said, ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away
He was doing very finely and he 'ppreciates your love
But his sho nough father wanted him in the big house up above,The Lord didn't give you that baby, by no hundred thousand miles
He just think you need some sunshine and he lent it for a while
And he let you keep and love him 'til your hearts were bigger grown
And these silver tears you're shedding now, are just interest on the loan,Just think my poor dear mourners creeping long on sorrow? s way
What a blessed picnic this here baby got today
Your good fathers and good mothers crowd the little fella round
In the angels 'tender garden of the big plantation ground,And his eyes they brightly sparkle at the pretty things he view
But a tear came and he whispered, ""I want my parents too""
Then the angel's chief musicians teach that little boy a song
Says if only they be faithful, they'll soon be comin' 'long,And so my poor dear mourners, let your hearts with Jesus rest
And don't go to criticizn' the one what knows the best
He has give us many comforts He's got the right to take away
To the Lord be praised in glory, now and ever, let us pray"

WRITER HANK WILLIAMS,Little Bosephus, you're the one, makes me feel good inside
Just to know that you're my son makes my heart swell with pride
I've always needed one like you to love and understand
Now that you've come to fill that place, you're my buddy, man to man
There comes a time when every boy grows so cocksure with life
So that he feels he knows it all and no longer needs advice
The complicated phase of life is called ""adolescent age""
And sometimes breaks a father's heart---wish you could skip that stage
I'd like to help you fill your heart with kindness, faith and truth
Protect you from the hands that reach out to destroy manhood and you
There is so much sorrow and despair to blight the hearts of men
And the more we learn of love and life, the more they come crowding in
It's just little things at first, my son, then, as we grow older
Our troubles grow much bigger too and sometimes, they overflow
The poisoned minds and broken hearts will cause strongest men to weep
Overwhelm souls with bitterness and death would be so sweet
So we must build a strong defense of love and fortitude
On character and knowledge, son, so these ills cannot intrude
Ah, Sonny boy, so many things a youngster needs to know
If he is to find true happiness as down through this life he goes
It's just a father's love, I guess, that comes to every Dad
That makes me want to shelter you from things that make you sad
Bosephis, boy, I'm standing by to help you when you call
For Son, you are my flesh and blood and the grandest pal of all"

Start with chapter twenty-four and read from one to thirty-three.
In our Savior's blessed words He said on earth, He prophesised,
For He spoke of this great battle that is coming by and by.,(Refrain),There'll be nation against nation, there'll be war and rumor of war.
There'll be great signs in Heaven, in the sun, the moon, the stars.
Oh, the hearts of men shall fail them, there'll be gnashing of the teeth.
Those who seek it will recieve it, mercy at the Savior's feet.,(Refrain)"

As I helped him cross the high-way
Oh! lord I cried his burdens are greater than mine.,I can see the light of day
I need not feel my way
Yes, thy burdens are greater than mine.,Met a lad while on my travels
Tryin' hard to play the game
Though his leg was very crippled
And he could not speak his name
Yet, he smiled in understandin'
Though life to him had been unkind
And as I watched, I cried in sorrow
Oh! lord his burdens are greater than mine.,I can speak my name aloud
Make my way among the crowd
Yes, his burdens are greater than mine.,Just by chance I passed a graveyard
I saw a young man kneelin' there
In his hand, there were some roses
On his lips, there was a prayer
On a stone, these words were written
'your soul is god's, your mem'ry mine'
And as I watched, I cried in sorrow
Oh! lord I see his burdens are greater than mine."

Hypothetical, working onto something that I'm proud of

I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and I happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me

I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand

Or it's gonna go down in flames

They'll tell you I'm insane

And you love the game,'Cause we're young, and we're reckless We'll take this way too far

But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name,Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby I'm your queen Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
But the worst's yet to come,Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Skip a second, guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she? ""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave 'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream,So, it's gonna be forever

Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal
Naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear sh! t but tomorrow,And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fvcking complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fvck with Lil Wayne
I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train,Cause I'm a sucker for pain
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it,No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age,No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses,I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you

And I'm bleeding out

For you,When the day has come
But I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating,Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong,'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do

I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you
For you,When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow,You tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong,'Cause I'm bleeding out

Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you

There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw,We all are living in a dream

Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night

For anyone but myself,I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk

fog in the air
just to make my mind seem clear
where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air
shaking hands run through my hair
my fears, where do I go from here?,Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other.,Walking down to the waters edge
asking why I'm here instead of home
now I stand alone.
I stop to stare at the ocean side
Im breathing in just to feel it's side,with his
like you were here with me.
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?,We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other.
Oh its on the warmest night
its in the brightest light,its when the world is moving.
Oh its in the faintest cry
its in the lovers eye
its when I need you most
And dont you know
Is it my fault, is it my fault?,We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other.
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other.

Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder,[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder,[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]

Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds,[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]

Broke down on a lonely highway
So loud, all the screams in my brain
Oh how I believed in my pain
Like it was my God
Looked back and I saw the dark clouds
Took that and I made my mom proud
It's easy to jump when you know how to fall
And lately I fall a lot
Don't wanna sit around and wait, just hanging on a fantasy
I'm trying to be the kind of person who creates an energy
I hope I got the storm inside to maybe make a better me
Some people chalk it up to fate, I don't believe in destiny
I guess I had a spark inside I couldn't light when I was younger
Oftentimes I think you really need to fight to find the hunger
Lightning gets the shine but I've
I've been working on the thunder,[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]

Once upon a time
In a far-off kingdom
There lay a small village
At the edge of the woods,[CINDERELLA]
I wish...,[NARRATOR]
And in this village,[CINDERELLA]
More than anything...,[NARRATOR]
lived a young maiden,,[CINDERELLA]
More than life...
More than jewels...,[NARRATOR]
A carefree young lad...,[JACK]
I wish...
More than life...,[NARRATOR]
And a childless baker...,[BAKER & WIFE]
I wish...,[NARRATOR]
with his wife.,[BAKER]
More than anything...,[WIFE]
More than the moon...,[BAKER'S WIFE]
I wish...,[CINDERELLA]
The King is giving a Festival.,[BAKER & WIFE]
More than life...,[JACK]
I wish...,[CINDERELLA]
I wish to go to the Festival.,[BAKER & WIFE]
More than riches...,[CINDERELLA]
and the ball...,[JACK]
I wish my cow would
give us some milk.,[CINDERELLA & BAKER'S WIFE]
More than anything...,[BAKER]
I wish we had a child.,[JACK]
Please, pal-,[BAKER'S WIFE]
I want a child...,[JACK]
Squeeze, pal...,[CINDERELLA]
I wish to go to the Festival.,[JACK]
I wish you'd give us some
milk or even cheese...
I wish...,[BAKER & WIFE]
I wish we might have a child.
I wish...,[STEPMOTHER]
You wish to go to the Festival?,[NARRATOR]
The poor girl's parents had died,,[STEPMOTHER]
You, Cinderella, the Festival?
You wish to go to the Festival?,[FLORINDA]
What, you, Cinderella, the Festival?
The Festival?!,[LUCINDA]
What, you wish to go to the Festival?,[ALL THREE]
The Festival?
The King's Festival?,[NARRATOR]
And now she lived with her stepmother,[STEPMOTHER]
The Festival...HA!,[NARRATOR]
who had two daughters of her own.,[FLORINDA]
Look at your nails!,[LUCINDA]
Look at your dress!,[STEPMOTHER]
People would laugh at you-,[CINDERELLA]
Nevertheless,
I still want to go to the Festival
And dance before the Prince.,[STEPMOTHER & STEPSISTERS]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...,[NARRATOR]
All three were beautiful of face, but vile and black of heart.
The young lad had no father and his mother-,[JACK'S MOTHER]
I wish...,[NARRATOR]
Well, she was at her wit's end-,[JACK'S MOTHER]
I wish my son were not a fool.
I wish my house was not a mess.
I wish the cow was full of milk.
I wish the walls were full of gold-
I wish a lot of things...
What in heaven's name are you doing
with the cow inside the house?,[JACK]
I thought if he got nice and warm,
he might produce some milk.,[JACK'S MOTHER]
It's a she...
How many times do I have to tell you,
only shes can give milk?,[NARRATOR]
And then there was a hungry little girl
who always wore a red cape.,[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
I wish...
It's not for me,
It's for my Granny in the woods.
A loaf of bread, please-
To bring my poor old hungry
Granny in the woods...
Just a loaf of bread, please...,[STEPMOTHER]
I have emptied a pot of lentils into the ashes for you.
If you have picked them out again in two hours time,
You shall go to the ball with us.,[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
And perhaps a sticky bun?
Or four?,[CINDERELLA]
Birds in the sky,
Birds in the eaves
And the leaves,
And the fields,
And the castles and ponds...,[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
And a few of those pies.,[CINDERELLA]
Quick little birds,
Down through the eaves,
And the leaves,
Over fields,
Out of castles and ponds...,[JACK]
Now, squeeze, pal...,[CINDERELLA]
Ahhhhhhhhhh...
Quick, little birds,
Flick through the ashes.
Pick and peck, but swiftly,
Sift through the ashes,
Into the pot...,[JACK'S MOTHER]
Now listen to me well, son.
Milky-White must be taken to market.,[JACK]
But, mother, no- he's the best cow.,[JACK'S MOTHER]
Look at her...
There are bugs on her dugs.
There are flies in her eyes.
There's a lump on her rump
Big enough to be a hump-,[JACK]
But-,[JACK'S MOTHER]
Son, we've no time to sit and dither,
While her wither's wither with her-
And no one keeps a cow for a friend!
Sometimes I fear you're touched...,[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
Into the woods,
It's time to go,
I hate to leave,
I have to go.
Into the woods-
It's time, and so
I must begin my journey.
Into the woods
And through the trees
To where I am
Expected ma'am,
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house-
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house-,[BAKER'S WIFE]
You're certain of your way?,[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
The way is clear,
The light is good,
I have no fear,
Nor no one should.
The woods are just trees,
The trees are just wood.
I sort of hate to ask it,
But do you have a basket?,[BAKER'S WIFE]
Yes, we do.,[BAKER]
I don't suppose you're planning on buying any of these-,[BAKER'S WIFE]
Oh, shhhhh...
Now, don't stray and be late, alright?,[BAKER]
You might save some of those sweets for Granny?
Oh my-,[BAKER'S WIFE]
Just, leave it...,[BAKER]
She's a thief!,[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
Into the woods
And down the dell,
The path is straight,
I know it well.
Into the woods,
And who can tell
What's waiting on the journey?
Into the woods
To bring some bread
To Granny who
Is sick in bed.
Never can tell
What lies ahead.
For all that I know,
She's already dead.
But into the woods,
Into the woods,
Into the woods
To Grandmother's house
And home before dark.
[FLORINDA]
Cinderella!,[LUCINDA]
Get up here!,[CINDERELLA]
Fly, birds,
Back to the sky...,[FLORINDA]
We're waiting!,[CINDERELLA]
Back to the eaves
And the leaves
And the fields
And the-,[FLORINDA]
Hurry up and do my hair, Cinderella!
Are you really wearing that?,[LUCINDA]
Here, I found a little tear, Cinderella.
Can't you hide it with a hat?,[CINDERELLA]
You look beautiful.,[FLORINDA]
I know.,[LUCINDA]
She means me.,[FLORINDA]
No she didn't.,[CINDERELLA]
Mother said be good,
Father said be nice,
That was always their advice.
So be nice, Cinderella,
Good, Cinderella,
Nice good good nice-,[FLORINDA]
Tighter!,[CINDERELLA]
What's the good of being good
If everyone is blind
Always leaving you behind?
Never mind, Cinderella,
Kind Cinderella-
Nice good nice kind good nice-,[FLORINDA]
OW- Not that tight!
Clod!,[BAKER]
Who might that be?,[BAKER'S WIFE]
We've sold our last loaf of bread!,[BAKER]
It's the witch from next-door.,[BAKER'S WIFE]
We have no bread...,[WITCH]
I don't want your bread...,[BAKER]
Then what is it you wish?,[WITCH]
It's not what I wish,
It's what you wish.
Nothing cooking in that belly now is there?
And there will never be,
Unless you do exactly as I say.
In three days time a blue-moon will appear,
Only then can the curse be, undone...,[BAKER'S WIFE]
What curse?,[WITCH]
The one I placed on this house.,[BAKER]
What are you talking about?,[WITCH]
In the past, when you were no more than a babe,
Your father brought his young wife
and you to this cottage.
They were a lovely couple,
But not lovely neighbors.
You see...
Your mother was with child,
And she developed an unusual appetite.
She admired my beautiful garden,
And she told your father that
What she wanted more than anything,
In the world, was...
Greens, greens, nothing but greens:
Parsley, peppers, cabbages and celery,
Asparagus and watercress and
Fiddleferns and lettuce-!
He said, ""All right,""
But it wasn't, quite,
'Cause I caught him in the autumn
In my garden one night!
He was robbing me,
raping me,
Rooting through my rutabaga,
Raiding my arugula and
Ripping up the rampion
My champion! My favorite!-
I should have laid a spell on him
Right there,
I could have turned him into stone
Or a dog...
Or a chair...
But I let him have the rampion-
I'd lots to spare.
In return, however,
I said, ""Fair is fair:
You can let me have the baby
That your wife will bear.
And we'll call it square."",[BAKER]
I had a brother?,[WITCH]
No. But, you had a sister.,[BAKER]
Where is she?,[WITCH]
She's mine now!
And you'll never find her,
Small price to pay for what
Else your father stole from me.
It cost me my youth, my beauty.
My mother warned me,
She would punish me
With the curse of ugliness,
If I ever lost any of them.,[BAKER'S WIFE]
Lost what?,[WITCH]
The beans...,[BAKER & WIFE]
Beans?,[WITCH]
The special beans...
I'd let him go, I didn't know,
he'd stolen my beans.
I was watching him crawl,
Back over the wall-!
Then bang! Crash!
A lightning flash!
Well, that's another story,
Never mind-
Anyway, at last
The big day came,
And I made my claim.
""Oh, don't take away the baby,""
They shrieked and screeched,
But I did,
And I hid her
Where she'll never be reached.
And your father cried,
And your mother died.
When for extra measure-
I admit it was a pleasure-
I said, ""Sorry,
I'm still not mollified.""
And I laid a little spell on them-
You, too, son-
That your family tree
Would always be a barren one...,[BAKER]
How could you do that?,[WITCH]
And when your mother died,
Your father deserted you.
Your father was no father so why should you be?,So there's no more fuss
And there's no more scenes
And my garden thrives-
You should see my nectarines!
But I'm telling you the same
I tell kings and queens:
Don't ever never ever
Mess around with my greens!
Especially the beans.,[JACK]
Yeah, but why do we have to go to the next village?,[JACK'S MOTHER]
Because, everyone in this village,
knows the cow hasn't given a drop of milk in weeks.,[JACK]
That's cheating!,[JACK'S MOTHER]
We're starving, Jack!
Don't you understand that?
Now, you're not to accept less than five pounds for her.
Are you listening to me?,[JACK]
Yes.,[JACK'S MOTHER]
How much are you to ask?,[JACK]
No more than five pounds.,[JACK'S MOTHER]
Less than five!,[JACK]
Than five!,[JACK'S MOTHER]
Into the woods,
The time is now,
We have to live,
I don't care how.
Into the woods to sell the cow,
You must begin the journey!
Straight to the woods
and don't delay-
We have to face
The marketplace.
Into the woods to journey's end-,[JACK]
Into the woods to sell a friend-,[WITCH]
You wish to have
The curse reversed?
I'll need a certain
Potion first.
Go to the woods and bring me back
One: the cow as white as milk,
Two: the cape as red as blood,
Three: the hair as yellow as corn,
Four: the slipper as pure as gold.
Bring me these
Before the chime
Of midnight,
In three day's time.
Tis' then the blue moon reappears.
Which comes but once each hundred years.
Just bring them and
I guarantee,
A child as perfect
As child can be.
Go to the wood!,[STEPMOTHER]
Ladies,
Our carriage waits.,[CINDERELLA]
Now may I go to the Festival?,[STEPMOTHER]
The Festival-?
Darling, those nails!
Darling, those clothes!
Lentils are one thing but
Darling, with those,
You'd make us the fools of the Festival
And mortify the Prince!,[CINDERELLA]
The Festival lasts three nights.
Surely, you could let me be there for one of them.,[STEPMOTHER]
The King is trying to find his son a wife!
Not a scullery maid!
We must be gone!
GO!,[CINDERELLA]
I wish-,[BAKER'S WIFE]
Beans?
These must be the witch's beans!
We'll take them with us.,[BAKER]
We?,[BAKER'S WIFE]
Yes!,[BAKER]
We?
You're not coming,
It's not safe out there.,[BAKER'S WIFE]
I can help you!,[BAKER]
No!
I can do this on my own.
The spell is on my house.
Only I can lift the spell,
The spell is on my house.,[BAKER'S WIFE]
No, no, the spell is on our house.
We must lift the spell together,
The spell is on our house!,[BAKER]
Now tell me what am I to return with?,[BAKER'S WIFE]
Ugh, You don't remember?
The cow as white as milk,
The cape as red as blood,
The hair as yellow as corn,
The slipper as pure as gold-,[BAKER]
The cow as white as milk,
The cape as red as blood,
The hair as yellow as corn,
The slipper as pure as gold...,[CINDERELLA]
I still wish to go to the Festival,
But how am I ever to get to the Festival?,[BAKER]
The cow as white as milk,
The cape as red as blood,
The hair as yellow as corn-,[CINDERELLA]
I know!
I'll visit Mother's grave,
The grave at the willow tree,
And tell her I just want to
Go to the King's Festival...,[BAKER]
The slipper as pure as gold...
The cow, the cape,
The slipper as pure as gold-,[BAKER'S WIFE]
The hair-!,[CINDERELLA & BAKER]
Into the woods,
It's time to go,
It may be all
In vain, you/I know.
Into the woods-
But even so,
I have to take the journey.,[CINDERELLA, BAKER & WIFE]
Into the woods,
The path is straight,
You know it well,
But who can tell-,[BAKER & WIFE]
Into the woods to lift the spell-,[CINDERELLA]
Into the woods to visit Mother-,[JACK'S MOM]
Into the woods to sell the cow!,[JACK]
To get the money!,[CINDERELLA]
To go to the Festival!,[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]
Into the woods to grandmother's house!
Into the woods to grandmother's house!,[ALL]
The way is clear,
The light is good,
I have no fear,
Nor no one should.
The woods are just trees,
The trees are just wood.
No need to be afraid there-,[BAKER]
There's something in the glade there...,[ALL]
Into the woods,
Without delay,
But careful not
To lose the way.
Into the woods,
Who knows what may
Be lurking on the journey?
Into the woods
To get the thing
That makes it worth
The journeying.
into the woods-,[STEPMOTHER & STEPSISTERS]
To see the King-,[JACK & MOTHER]
To sell the cow-,[BAKER & WIFE]
To make the potion-,[ALL]
To see-
To sell-

To bring-
To make-
To live-
To go to the Festival-!

And home before dark!"

Mother said,
""Straight ahead,
Not to delay
or be misled.""
I should have heeded
Her advice...
But he seemed so nice.
And he showed me things
Many beautiful things,
That I hadn't thought to explore.
They were off my path,
So I never had dared.
I had been so careful,
I never had cared
And he made me feel excited-
Well, excited and scared.
When he said, ""Come in!""
With that sickening grin,
How could I know what was in store?
Once his teeth were bared,
Though, I really got scared-
Well, excited and scared-
But he drew me close
And he swallowed me down,
Down a dark slimy path
Where lie secrets that I never want to know
And when everything familiar seems to disappear forever
At the end of the path was granny once again
So we lie in the dark till you came and set us free
And you brought us to the light
And we're back at the start,And I know things now,
Many valuable things,
That I hadn't known before:
Do not put your faith
In a cape and a hood,
They will not protect you
The way that they should.
And take extra care with strangers,
Even flowers have their dangers.
And though scary is exciting,
Nice is different than good.
Now I know:
Don't be scared.
Granny is right,
Just be prepared.
Isn't it nice to know a lot!
And a little bit,{wait 8 beats},...NOT!"

He's a very smart Prince,
He's a Prince who prepares.
Knowing this time I'd run from him,
He spread pitch on the stairs.
And I'm caught unawares.
Well it means that he cares-
This is more than just malice.
Better stop and take stock
While you're standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace.,All right what do you want?
Have to make a decision.
Why not stay and be caught?
Should I give that a thought,
What would be his response?
But then what if he knew
Who I am when I know
That I'm not what he thinks
That he wants?,Or, then, what if I am?
What a Prince would envision?
But then how can you know
Who you are till you know
What you want, which I don't?
So then which do you pick:
Where you're safe, out of sight,
And yourself, but where everything's wrong?
Or where everything's right
But you know that you'll never belong?,And whichever you pick,
Do it quick,
'Cause you're starting to stick
To the steps of the palace.,It's my first big decision,
The choice isn't easy to make.
To arrive at a ball
Is exciting and all-
Once you're there, though, it's scary.
And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave,
But you have to be wary.
There's a lot that's at stake,
But I've stalled long enough,
'Cause I'm still standing stuck
In the stuff on these steps...,Better run along home
And avoid the collision.
Though at home they don't care,
I'll be better off there
Where there's nothing to choose,
So there's nothing to lose.
So I'll pry up my shoes.
Wait no thinking it through,
Things don't have to collide
I know what my decision is,
Which is not to decide.
I'll just leave him a clue:
For example, a shoe.
And then see what he'll do.,Now it's he and not you
Who'll be stuck with a shoe,
In a stew, in the goo.
And I've learned something, too,
Something I never knew,
On the steps of the palace."

You're not the man who started,
And much more openhearted
Than I knew
You to be.,[BAKER]
It takes two.
I thought one was enough,
It's not true:
It takes two of us
You came through
When the journey was rough.
It took you.
It took two of us.
It takes care.
It takes patience and fear and despair
To change.
Though you swear
To change,
Who can tell if you do?,[BAKER'S WIFE]
(It takes 2) You've changed.
You're thriving.
There's something about the woods.
Not just
Surviving.
You're blossoming in the woods.
At home I'd fear
We'd stay the same forever.
And then out here-
You're passionate
Charming,
Considerate,
Clever-,[BAKER]
It takes one
To begin, but then once
You've begun,
It takes two of you.
It's no fun,
But what needs to be done
You can do
When there's two of you.
If I dare,
It's because I'm becoming
Aware of us
As a pair of us,
Each accepting a share
Of what's there.,[BOTH]
We've changed,
We're strangers
I'm meeting you in the woods.
Who minds,
What dangers?
I know we'll get past the woods.
And once we're passed
Let's hope the changes last.
Beyond woods,
Beyond witches and slippers and hoods
Just the two of us.
Beyond lies,
Safe at home with our beautiful prize,
Just the few of us.
It takes trust,
It takes just a bit more and we're done.
We want four,
We had none,
We've got three,
We need one,
It takes two."

To describe what you feel

Was now right and those who deserved to
Were certain to live a long and happy life
Ever after, ever after,Journey over, all is mended
And it's not just for today
But tomorrow and extended
Ever after, ever after,All the curses have been ended
The reverses wiped away
All is tenderness and laughter
For forever after,Happy now and happy hence
And happy ever after,There were dangers
We were frightened
And confusions
But we hid it,And the paths would often swerve
We did not
There were constant
It's amazing,Disillusions
That we did it
But they never lost they're nerve
Not a lot
And we reached the right conclusions
And we got what we deserved,Not a sigh and not a sorrow
Tenderness and laughter
Joy today and bliss tomorrow
And forever after,I was greedy
I was vain
I was haughty
I was smug, we were happy,It was fun
But we were blind
Then we went into the woods
To get our wish and now we're really blind,I was perfect
I had everything but beauty
I had power
And a daughter like a flower in a tower,Then I went into the woods
To get my wish
And now I'm ordinary
We're unworthy
Lost my power and my flower,We're unhappy now, unhappy hence
As well as ever after
Had we used our common sense,Been worthy of our discontents
We'd be happy,To be happy and forever

Don't be careful, don't be clever
When you see your wish, pursue,It's a dangerous endeavor
But the only thing to do
Though it's fearful
Though it's deep, though it's dark,And though you may lose your path
Though you may encounter wolves
You mustn't stop, you mustn't swerve
You mustn't ponder, you have to act,When you know your wish
If you want your wish
You can have your wish
But you can't just wish
No, to get your wish,You go into the woods where nothing's clear
Where witches, ghosts and wolves appear
Into the woods and through the fear
You have to take the journey,Into the woods and down the dell
In vain, perhaps, but who can tell?
Into the woods to lift the spell
Into the woods to lose the longing,Into the woods to have the child
To wed the Prince, to get the money
To save the house, to kill the Wolf
To find the father, to conquer the kingdom,To have, to wed, to get, to save
To kill, to keep, to go to the festival
Into the woods, into the woods
Into the woods, then out of the woods
to be continued..
And happy ever after"

Agony such that princes must weep
Always in thrall 'most to anything almost

The quickest is pick it apart with a stick

While they lie there for years
And you cry on their biers

Don't you be afraid, child, ain't no reason to conceal it
This is your good time, let's try to work it out
If the spirit moves ya, let it lose ya in the groove
of what you know is right
Do you know what I mean?
Is it something you just can't receive?
And it's not what it seems
Still it's better to believe than to have seen
Do you know what I mean?
When I say it comes down to what is real
Maybe it's not what it seems, oh yeah
Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe
Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe
Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe
Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe
Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe"

There were green alligators and long necked geese,
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.,Now God seen some sinning and it gave Him pain,
And He says ""Stand back, I'm going to make it rain.""
He says ""Hey brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do,
Build me a floating zoo. And take some of them...,Chorus 2

Them Unicorns were hiding, playing silly games.
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pouring,
Oh them silly Unicorns.,Chorus 4

Noah cried ""Close the door, cause the rain is pouring,
And we just can't wait for no Unicorn."",The ark started movin, it drifted with the tide.
Them Unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried,
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away,
And that's why you'll never seen a Unicorn... to this very day.,Chorus 5
You'll see green alligators and long necked geese,
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,

Just give me a breeze on a good rolling sea
I'll play me old squeeze-box as we sail along
With the wind in the riggin' to sing me a song,Wrap me up in me oilskins and jumper

They were married in two churches, lived happily enough
Until the day that I was born and things got rather tough,Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green,Baptised by father Reilly, I was rushed away by car
To be made a little orangeman, my father's shining star
I was christened David Anthony, but still in spite of that
To my father I was William while my mother called me Pat,Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green,With mother every Sunday to mass I'd proudly stroll
Then after that the orange lads would try to save my soul
For both sides tried to claim me, but I was smart because
I played the flute or played the harp, depending where I was,
Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green,One day my ma's relations came round to visit me
Just as my father's kinfolk were all sittin' down to tea
We tried to smooth things over, but they all began to fight
And me being strictly neutral, I bashed everyone in sight,Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green,Now my parents never could agree about my type of school
My learning was all done at home, that's why I'm such a fool
They both passed on, god rest them, but left me caught between
That awful color problem of the orange and the green,Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen
My father he was orange and my mother she was green,Yes it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen

Rolling with a wee girl underneath the tree
A bungbee stung me well above the knee
Up among the heather at the hill a' Benachee,Come all you bonny lassies please take my advice
Never let a soldier laddy kiss you more than twice
For all the time he's kissing you, he's thinking out a plan

Wore it like a hat
I saw someone under my kitchen table
Talking to my old tom cat
They were talking about hockey
The cat was talking back
Long about then everything went black
Wasn't that a party,I'm sure it's just my memory
Playing tricks on me
But I think I saw my buddy
Cutting down my neighbor's tree,(chorus),Billy Joe and Tommy
Well they went a little far
They were sitting in the back yard, blowing on a siren
From somebody's police car,So you see, Your Honor
It was all in fun
The little bitty track meet down on main street
Was just to see if the cops could run
Well they run us in to see you
In an alcoholic haze
I sure can use those thirty days
To recover from the party,(repeat chorus x2, fade)"

I don't know, maybe so,
But a bachelor is easy and he's free.
But I've lots to look after, though I'm living all alone.
Sure nobody's looking after me.
My father often tells me I should go and have a try
To find a girl that owns a bit of land.
And I know, the way he says it, that there's someone on his mind.
And my mother has the whole thing planned.
I don't know, maybe so,
But t'would mollify them greatly to agree.
Now, there's little Bridget Flynn, sure it's her I'd love to win,
But she never has an eye for me.
Now there's a little girl who's worth her weight in gold.
And that's a decent dowry, don't you see?
And I mean to go and ask her just as soon as I get bold,
If she'll come and have an eye for me.
Will she go? I don't know.
But I'd love to have her sitting on my knee.
And I'll sing like a thrush in a hawthorn bush
If she'll come and have an eye for me."

Walkin' home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa, we believe,She'd been drinking too much eggnog
And we begged her not to go
But she left her medication
And she stumbled out the door into the snow,When they found her Christmas morning
At the scene of the attack
There were hoofprints on her forehead
And incriminating claws marks on her back,Grandma got run over by a Reindeer
Walkin' home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa, we believe,Now we're all so proud of grandpa
He's been taking this so well
See him in there watching football
Drinking beer and playing cards with cousin Mel,It's not Christmas without grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts
Or send them back?,Grandma got run over by a Reindeer
Walkin' home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa, we believe,Now the goose is on the table
And the puddin' made a face
And a blue and silver candle
That would just have matched the hair in grandma's wig,I've warned all my friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh
(Or plays with elves...),Grandma got run over by a Reindeer
Walkin' home from our house Christmas Eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa, we believe,Grandma got run over by a Reindeer
Walkin' home from our house Christmas Eve

And before I signed to work for him he was very nice to me.
He promised me eggs and bacon and he then shook hands with me.,I welcome with me Johnny

When I come down for me breakfast, well what do you think I see?
But a dozen squabbling children saying, ""Is there anything there for me?"",I welcome with me Johnny

Twas little I knew what I had to do
for Brady of Strabane.,Each morning I arose from work at the dawning of the day.
I tend to his cows and horses and feed them oats and hay.
Then off to plough the pastures and plant the spuds and corn.
Each night before I went to sleep I wish I ne'er been born.,I welcome with me Johnny
And you're with a decent man.
Twas little I knew what I had to do
for Brady of Strabane.,I worked on Brady's farm 'till I looked an awful sight
Me bones were pushin' through me skin. I worked from mornin' 'till night
And when I died and passed away old Brady gave a grin.
Said, ""He'll make good fertilizer, and there's plenty more like him."",I welcome with me Johnny

Et si tu m'ignores
Je t'offrirai mon dernier souffle de vie,Dans ma love story

Peut illuminer la nuit
Un sourire
Peut bâtir tout un empire
Et il y a toi
Et il y a moi

Avec le temps...,Et je rame, rame, rame, rame, je rame sur les eaux
Et je rame, rame, rame, rame, mais l'espoir coule à flot
Et je rame, rame, rame, rame, je rame sur les eaux
Et je rame, rame, rame, rame...,Un peu comme un bateau
J'avance face à la mer
Je navigue sur les flots
Un peu comme un bateau
J'avance et je suis fière
De ce que porte mon dos
Un peu comme un bateau
Qui trouve son équilibre
Entre les vagues et le chaos
Un peu comme un bateau
J'avance, je suis fière
De ce que porte mon dos
Un peu comme un bateau,Comme un bateau

Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she laid there sleepin'
I red the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I red
If you like piña coladas
and getting cought in the rain
If you're not into yoga
if you haf half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
in the dunes of a cape
I'm the love that you looked for
write to me and escape
...
I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kinda mean
but me and my old lady
have fallen into the same old routine
so I wrote to the paper
took out a personal add
and thoug I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad
Yes I like piña coladas
and getting cought in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champange
I've got to get you by tomorrow
and cut thru all this red tape
at a bar ...
where we plan our escape
...
So I waited with high hopes
and she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
it was my old lovely lady
and she said ""oh it's you""
then we laughed for a moment
and I said I neve knew
that you like piña coladas
and getting cought in the rain
and the feel of the ocean
and the taste of champange
if you like making love at midnoghts
in the dunes of a cape
you're the lady I looked for
come with me and escape
If you like piña coladas

if you have half a brain
if you like making love at midnights

Hoped to see the sun again

They hang out in the local bars
And they feed right after dark,Can't you feel them circling, honey?
Can't you feel them swimming around?
You got fins to the left, fins to the right
And you're the only bait in town
Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh-woah
You got fins to the left, fins to the right
And you're the only girl in town,She's saving up all of her money
Wants to hit it south in may
Maybe roll in the sand with a rock 'n roll man
Somewhere down Monserat Way
But the money's good, and the season
Helps to lighten up her load
Boys keep her high as the months go by
She's getting post cards from the road,Can't you feel them closing in, honey?
Can't you feel them schooling around?
You got fins to the left, fins to the right
And you're the only girl in town,Sailed off to Antigua
It took her three days on a boat
Looking for some peace and quiet
Maybe keep her dreams afloat
But now she feels like A remora
With the school still close at hand
Just behind the reef are the big white teath
Of the sharks that can swim on the land,Can't you feel them circling, honey?
Can't you feel them schoolin' around?

Feel that warm breeze on her gentle skin

Someday she's gonna learn how to fly
Oh that I won't deny,Chorus:
I catch a little more dialogue comin' my way
I see those big brown eyes just start to lookin' astray
Your mother's still the only other woman for me
Little Miss Magic, what you gonna be?,Yes she loves to ride into town with the top down
Feel that warm breeze on her gentle skin
She is my next of kin,Constantly amazed by the blades of the fan on the ceiling
Those clever little looks she gives just can't help but be appealing
I know someday she'll learn to make up her own rhymes
One day she's gonna learn how to fly
That I won't deny,Chorus:
I see a little more of me everyday
I feel a little more moustache turning gray
Your mother's still the only other woman for me
Little Miss Magic, what you gonna be?
Little Miss Magic, what you gonna be?
Little Miss Magic, just can't wait to see,It's raining, It's pouring
Your old man is snoring"

Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum

Visions of good times that brought so much pleasure
Makes me want to go back again

I could somehow adjust to the fall
Good times and riches and son of a bitches

There's just too much to see waiting in front of me

Drinking lots of carrot juice and soaking up rays

Not zucchini fettucini or bulgar wheat
But a big warm bun and a huge hunk of meat,Cheeseburger in paradise
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
Not too particular not too precise
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise,Heard about the oldtime sailor men
They'd eat the same thing again and again
Warm beer and bread they said could raise the dead
Well it reminds me of the menu at a Holiday Inn
But times have changed for sailors these days
When I'm in port I get what I need
Not just havanas or banana or daiquiris
But that American creation on which I feed,Cheeseburger in paradise
Medium-rare with munster'd be nice
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise,I like mine with lettuce and tomato
Heinz 57 and french fried potatoes
Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer
Well good God almighty which way do I steer
For my...

Making the best of every virtue and vice
Worth every damn bit of sacrifice
To get a cheeseburger in paradise
Get me a cheeseburger in paradise

[Song for the little children]
Now young Mister Moon flew away in the night
With his best friend Magnus right by his side
They soared through the Milky Way counting the stars
Once around Venus twice around Mars,Then they spied an island rise out of the sea
They fell back to Earth just as free as you please
The children all gathered the church bells did ring
Suddenly everyone started to sing,Chorus:
Chanson pour les petits enfants
Chanson pour tout le monde
Chanson pour les petits enfants
Chanson pour tout le monde,Queen of the island she welcomed them in
Asking 'em questions of where they had been
She offered 'em chocolate she offered them tea
They all took their seats in the top of a tree,And racoons brought wine and the mice they brought cheese
Beautiful birds floated by on the breeze
From out in the oceans the dolphins began
Humming a tune that soon covered the land,Chorus:
Chanson pour les petits enfants
Chanson pour tout le monde
Chanson pour les petits enfants
Chanson pour tout le monde,So young Princess Leia brought coral and pearls
Gifts to the travelers from some other world
The Bushdoctor mixed up a magical spell
Swore them to secrecy never to tell,So young Mister Moon flew away in the night
With his best friend Magnus still right by his side
The sun was just rising, they'd be home by noon
Humming the words to this magical tune,Chorus:

As he greets you at the border,And the lady she hails from Trinidad
Island of the spices
Salt for your meat, and cinnamon sweet
And the rum is for all your good vices,Haul the sheet in as we ride on the wind
That our forefathers harnessed before us
Hear the bells ring as the tight rigging sings
It's a son of a gun of a chorus,Where it all ends I can't fathom my friends

For marius skatelborough
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei,I know I don't get there often enough
But God knows I surely try
It's a magic kind of medicine
That no doctor could prescribe,I used to rule my world from a pay phone
Ships out on the sea
But now times are rough
And I got too much stuff
Can't explain likes of me,Chorus:
But there's this one particular harbour
So far but yet so near
Where I see the days as they fade away
And finally disappear,But now I think about the good times
Down in the caribbean sunshine
In my younger days I was so bad
Laughin' about all the fun we had,I seen enough to feel the world spin
Mixin' different oceans meetin' cousins
Listen to the drummers and the night sounds
Listen to the singers make the world go 'round,(pan solo),Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei,Lakes below the mountain
Flow into the sea
Like oils applied to canvas
They permeate through me,And there's that one particular harbour
Sheltered from the wind
Where the children play on the shore each day
And all are safe within,Most mysterious calling harbour
So far but yet so near
I can see the day when my hair's full gray
And I finally disappear,Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei
Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei,Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei
Ia ora te natura (ua pau te maitai no te fenua)
E mea arofa teie ao nei,Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei
Ia ora te natura (ua pau te maitai no te fenua)
E mea arofa teie ao nei, hey now, hey now, hey now,Ia ora te natura
E mea arofa teie ao nei,Ua pau te maitai no te fenua [bounty of the land is exhausted]

I've seen a lot of girls since then

Instead of being my deliverance
She had a strange resemblance
To a cat name Frankenstein,Chorus:

How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way,It's hard on a fella
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey
To help me spend this money
I'm headin' back to Key West town,Chorus:

If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape

I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape,So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady and she said, ""Oh, it's you""
And we laughed for a moment and I said, ""I never knew,That you liked Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain

With the words from grandma ghost,Hiding from the dragons
Riding for the sea
Singing ballads from my childhood
""A pirate's life for me"",Survivors seem to function best
When peril is at hand
With a song of the ocean
Meets a salty piece of land,I was force-fed my religion

But a schooner was her home
She has centuries of stories
And there's wisdom in her bones,She was on a sacred mission
And she told me of a place
Where a man can hide forever
But never loose his face,So I saddled up my seahorse
With a fly-rod in my hand
I was not looking for salvation
Just a salty piece of land,Somedays Cayo Loco SHIMMERS
Like the stars up in the sky
And the seabirds they do touch and gos
As the world just tangos by,But there are times when she is hidden
Beneath the wild and crashing waves
And the patron saint of lightening
Keeps the sailors from their graves,Some say it is a blinding sword
Pointing out into the sea
While others say her guiding light
Leads to'ards eternity,Still I sit in contemplation
And I just don't understand
This mysterious attraction
Of this salty piece of land,Still I search the constellations
And the tiny grains of sand
Where the song of the ocean
Meets the salty piece of land"

And they marked it all down as the progress of man,When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am,Hey, daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train done hauled it away
Mister Peabody's coal train done hauled it away"

I saw him the night I was born,
In a Bourbon Street bar I received my first scar
From an old man so tattered and torn.,And the Wino and I know the pains of street singin'
Like the door-to-door salesman knows
The pains of bell ringin'
It's a strange situation,
A wild occupation,
Living my life like a song.,Well the coffee is strong
At the Cafe do Monde,
And the donuts are too hot to touch,
But just like a fool, when those
Sweet goodies cool, I ate 'til I ate way too much.
Cause I'm livin' on things that excite me,
Be they pastries or lobsters or love,
I'm just tryin' to get by being quiet and shy,
In a world full of pushin' and shove.,And the Wino and I know the pains of backbustin',
Like the farmer knows the pain of his pick-up
Truck rustin'.
It's a strange situation, a wild occupation,
Living my life like a song.,Sweet Senorita, won't you please come with me?
Back to the island, honey, back to the sea,
Back to the only place that I want to be.,And the Wino and I know the joys of the ocean,
Like a boy knows the joys of his milkshake
In motion.
It's a strange situation, a wild occupation,
Living my life like a song."

His lawyers are calling his parents
His girlfriend doesn't know what to think
His partners are studying their options
He's just singin' and orderin' drinks,Chorus:
The weather is here I wish you were beautiful
The skies are too clear life's so easy today
The beer is too cold, the daiquiri's too fruitiful
No place like home when you're this far away

It was something that he should have done such a long time ago

By: Jimmy Buffett
1978
There's a cowboy in the jungle
And he looks so out of place
With his shrimpskin boots and his cheap cheroots
And his skin as white as paste,Headin' south to Paraguay
Where the Gauchos sing and shout
Now he's stuck in Porto Bello
Since his money all ran out
So he hangs out with the sailors
Night and day they're raisin' hell
And his original destination's just another
Story that he loves to tell,With no plans for the future
He still seems in control
From a bronco ride to a ten foot tide
He just had to learn to roll,Chorus:
Roll with the punches
Play all of his hunches
Make the best of whatever came his way
What he lacked in ambition
He made up with intuition
Plowing straight ahead come what may,Steel band in the distance
And their music floats across the bay
While American women in moomoos
Talk about all the things they did today
And their husbands quack about fishing
As they slug those rum drinks down
Discussing who caught what and who sat on his butt
But it's the only show in town.,Chorus:
They're tryin' to drink all the punches
They all may lose their lunches
Tryin' to cram lost years into five or six days
Seems that blind ambition erased their intuition
Plowin' straight ahead come what may.,I don't want to live on that kind of island
No I don't want to swim in a roped off sea
Too much for me, too much for me
I've got to be where the wind and the water are free.,Alone on a midnight passage
I can count the falling stars
While the Southern Cross and the satellites
They remind me of where we are
Spinning around in circles
Living it day to day
And still twenty four hours may be sixty good years
It's still not that long a stay.,Chorus:
We've gotta roll with the punches
Learn to play all of our hunches
Makin' the best of whatever comes your way
Forget that blind ambition
And learn to trust your intuition
Plowin' straight ahead come what may
And there's a cowboy in the jungle"

But it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day

Somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you

Spoken intro with music playing:,This is a song that started a long time ago. Back when there
was just the water world. There was this strange looking fish
that moved along the hidden currents of the deep dark ocean.
He knew he was different because he could sense there was
something else in his nature. He swam in circles for millions
of years and one day he decided it was time to go up. He
was soon in the world of light where he remained a long time
until his eyes allowed him to see color. The world was no
longer a dark place and he moved further up into the light
and one day before he knew it he was no longer in the water
world. His head was above the surface and he felt his gills
turn into lungs and he said ""Ah shit! I'm an amphibian!""
Then he slowly swam towards the shallow waters and
marshes of the shore and one day he felt the ground
beneath his feet. There he gathered his wits, checked
his balance, and stood erect. And THAT'S when the
trouble began!,Well the birds disappeared and the sky began to turn purple,
>From the skeleton coast to the land of violins.
Sailors prayed to the patron saint of lightening,
""Please St. Barbara, save our miserable skins."",They say that God takes care of drunks and fools and children,
That leaves the rest of us rummaging for alibis.
But friends there's trouble, trouble on the horizon,
And it wears an inconspicuous disguise.
You never see it coming,
You never have a clue,
But there's trouble on the horizon,
Bubbling like a roux.,You have to taste the weather,
You've got to touch the storm.
There is trouble on the horizon,
Waiting to perform.,You gave us cigarettes, guns, and whiskey,
And watch what happens,
Then add a little nuclear fusion and some gasoline.,We got trouble, trouble right here in River City,
Every day's becoming Halloween.,We never see it coming,
We never have a clue,
But there's trouble on the horizon,
Waiting for the barbecue.,You have to taste the weather,
You've got to touch the storm.
There is trouble on the horizon,
Waiting to perform.,I've seen a spaceship built by Howard Hughes,
I've been a witness to some strange taboos.
I've seen a storm from deep inside the eye
Of hurricane don't lie.
Hurricane's don't lie.,In the hour of desperation,
You'll cry like a baby.
When it comes right down to merely molecules.
Hell, you can pray to Jesus or a flock of pink flamingos.,
but in the hour of desperation are the fools.,I hope that all the greedy bastards in the world
Come back as lobsters.
You know that life at the bottom of the food chain
Suits them well.
I think that all of the evil people of the world
Come back as horseflies,
They want one last bite before they're sent to hell.,You better know it's coming,
You've got to have a clue,
There is trouble on the horizon,
Bubbling like a roux.,You have to taste the weather,
You've got to touch the storm.
To keep trouble on the horizon,
You got to stay informed.,Trouble out there, ain't going no where,
Trouble on the horizon,
Trouble out there, ain't going no where,
You got to trouble on the horizon,
Trouble out there,
Trouble out there,
I see bad moon arising."

Most of 'em dream, most of 'em dream,Yes I am a pirate, two hundred years too late
The cannons don't thunder, there's nothin' to plunder
I'm an over-forty victim of fate
Arriving too late, arriving too late,I've done a bit of smugglin', I've run my share of grass
I made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast
Never meant to last, never meant to last,And I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks
But I got stop wishin', got to go fishin'
Down to rock bottom again
Just a few friends, just a few friends,(instrumental),I go for younger women, lived with several awhile
Though I ran 'em away, they'd come back one day
Still could manage to smile
Just takes a while, just takes a while,Mother, mother ocean, after all the years I've found
My occupational hazard being my occupation's just not around
I feel like I've drowned, gonna head uptown,Coda:
I feel like I've drowned, gonna head uptown"

That the news is all bad
I think it's time for a song about that.,Up on the East side of Manhattan,
They're still dancing with the stars.
While over in the sub prime city,
It's getting ugly in the local bars
Watching the news only gives me the blues
There's too much going wrong.
It takes the likes of me to hit the reboot key
And write a high speed drinking song.,Millionaires losin' everything.
Hey, welcome to the other side of life!
There goes the yacht, there goes the rolls,
But, you get to keep your wife!
And don't forget the automakers
Swimming up stream like a trout.
They let the shi* hit the fan
And then they made a plan
We've got a lot to drink about.,It's the price of oil,
The war of the spoils.
Here's your bucket for the big bailout
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,
We've got a lot to drink about.,Now, Madoff made off with all the money.
And his clients are down to skunk weed.
Repeat after me, it's so easy to see
We're only talking simple greed.
And those Somalian pirates are counting all their gold.
While Bush and Cheney ain't around
And all the good lookers seem to be Russian hookers
From Key West to London town.,With the price of oil,
War of the spoils.
Here's your bucket for the big bailout.
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,
We've got a lot to drink about.,So pour me some Tennessee whiskey,
Pour me a fine Jamaican rum.
That loud mouth soup
Can get ya kind of looped
Tequila, of course I'll have some!,Well the family devalues
And little children plan their net worth
And the truth wherever it's hiding,
Can't be found on Google Earth.
Citibank's buying jets with our money.
I wanna flog 'em with a buggy whip.
Let's hope Barack and Joe won't let the volcano blow
And patch the hole in our sinking ship.,There's the price of oil,
War of the spoils.
Here's your bucket for the big bailout.
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,
We've got a lot to drink about.,Recession, Aggression, Depression good God
CNN keeps bummin' me out.
I can't take another doomsday minute.
Got a lot to drink, a lot to think,
A lot to drink about.,God bless America"

By: Jimmy Buffett, Michael Utley
1988
Pat Conroy, Doc Pomus and the people of Dafuskie Island have already said it all. I am thankful for such inspiration.
--Spoken:
""The sun, red and enormous, began to sink into the western sky. And simultaneously the moon began to rise on the other side of the river with its own glorious shade of red, coming up out of the trees like a russet firebird. The sun and the moon seem to acknowledge each other and they moved in both apposition and concordance in a breath taking dance of light across the oaks and the palms. My father watched it and I thought he would cry again. He had returned to the sea, and his heart was a low country heart."",African drums are silent and the Wingos are poets at last
Out on Dafuskie Island, the bulldozers bury the past
And the low country sinks, she can not swim
The dogwood feels the hurt
While the foursome plays on borrowed days in their alligator shirts,Chorus:
Now I realize who killed the Prince of Tides
How can you tell how it used to be
When there's nothin' left to see,One night they put a price on the sunset
And that got the whole world shaking
They rose from the grave both the weak and the brave
'Cause history was there for the makin'
And the winos surrounded the condos forming a frail human fence
And they shouted out loud to the roar of the crowd
""Same old story, more dollars than sense"",Chorus:
Now I realize who killed the Prince of Tides
How can you tell how it used to be
When there's nothin' left to see,Paperback novels make young girls dream
And Judy's spending quieter days in the stream
With Goodman, Giovinno, and John Mac D
They were such good friends to me,(instrumental),Chorus:
Yes and now I realize who killed the Prince of Tides
How can you tell how it used to be
When there's nothin' left to see,Chorus:
Oh, and now I realize who killed the Prince of Tides
How can you tell how it used to be
When there's nothin' left to see
Nothin' left to see,Heaven knows but God decides
Just when to kill the Prince of Tides,You can dance (you can dance) every dance (you can dance)
With the guy (you can dance) who gives you the eye (you can dance)
And wants to hold you tight (you can dance)
You can smile (you can smile) every smile (you can smile)
For the man (you can smile) who holds your hand
Beneath the pale moonlight (you can dance, ba-dum)
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Save the last dance for me,And beach music, beach music, beach music, just plays on...,-- Spoken:
""The white porpoise comes to me at night, singing in the river of time, with a thousand dolphins in radiant attendance, bringing charismatic greetings from the Prince of Tides."""

Et la fete ne s'arretait jamais

Well it wasn't really a hotel, it was a patio
bar with funky rooms and an outdoor disco
with bad wiring. Some people said if you looked
between the cracks of the floorboards of our
dance floor you would see Hell. If you ever
went there, you would know what I'm talking
about. If you never had, then we
thought we'd send you a little musical souvenir.,Some say it was a planet
Some say it was a rock
For five wild years in L""Orient
The party never stopped,There were pirates from the Indies
There were models from Paris
There were locals and New Yorkers
And the Brazilian Navy,By mini-moke and scooters
In cabs and stolen cars
Came the creatures of the evening
From St. Martin and from Mars,Alors, Alors, Alors, Alors alors come on, come on

On croisera les fantomes du passe
Viens faire un tour autour du rocher
Sur les souvenirs l'herbe a poussee,Girl at the pool table
puts on a show for free
They were bivouacked in the bathroom
By the hot tub near the sea,Every night at midnight
Seems the devil took control
And the hill became a parking lot
Fueled by rock 'n' roll,They were talking by the cannon
But I couldn't believe my ears
The Russian had plutonium
The sailor wanted beers,They shook hands in the moonlight
And broke out a big cigar
Just business as usual
Beneath the tropic stars,Alors(come on) alors (let's go) alors
Vien faire in tour autour du rocher
On croisera les fantomes du pass'e
Viens faire un tour autour du richer
Sur les souvinirs l'herbe a poussee,It was better than a painting
At le Musee de Beaux Arts
And simply what we did for fun
Back in the old St. Barts,Then the glitz and all the glamour
Hit like a hurricane
Or maybe we just all grew up
But it never was the same,The gendarmes finally closed the joint
And the fire it did the rest
But on New Year's Eve of '91
We sang the last request,We were dancing in the ashes
We were dancing in the sea
We were dancing in the ruins
Where we left our memories
Come on let's go alors
Vien faire un tour autour du rocher
On croisera les fantomes du pass'e
Viens faire un tour autour du rocher
Sur les souvinirs l'herbe a poussee,Alors. Alors, Alors, Alors

I rounded first never thought of the worst
As I studied the shortstop's position
Crack went my leg like the shell of an egg
Someone call a decent physician
I'm no Pete Rose, I can't pretend
Though my mind is quite flexible, these brittle bones don't bend,Chorus:
I'm growing older but not up
My metabolic rate is pleasantly stuck
Let those winds of time blow over my head
I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead,Sometimes I see me as old manatee
Headin' south as the waters grow colder
Tries to steer clear of the hum-drum so near
It cuts prop scars deep in his shoulder
But that's how it goes (that's how it goes), right to the end
Though his body's quite flexible, that barnacle brain don't bend,Chorus:
I'm growing older but not up
My metabolic rate is pleasantly stuck
Let those winds of time blow over my head
I'd rather die while I'm livin' than live while I'm dead,(instrumental),Now don't get me wrong
This is not a sad song
Just events that I have happened to witness
And time takes its toll as we head for the poll
And no one dies from physical fitness
So what the hell, we'll take it right to the end
As the days grow more complicated the nightlife still wins,Chorus:
I'm growing older but not up
My metabolic rate is pleasantly stuck
Let those winds of change blow over my head
I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead
Let those winds of time blow over my head
I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead"

I guess we are the people our parents warned us about,You know I coulda worked the rigs when the money was big
Or hopped a freighter south to Trinidad
And when they tried to draft me I earned a college degree
Buyin' time 'til things were not so bad
But then I got a guitar found a job in a bar
Playin' acid rock 'til I was numb
Tell me where are the flashbacks they all warned us would come,Chorus:
We are the people, they couldn't figure out
We are the people our parents warned us about,Hey hey, Gardner McKay
Take us on the Leaky Tiki with you
Clear skies bound for Shanghai
Sailing cross the ocean blue (do do do dooo)
So blue (do do do dooo OOOH)
(do do do dooo)
(do do do dooo OOOH),Now I got quarters in my loafers tryin' to fight inflation
When it only used to take a cent
Sometimes I wish I was back in my crashpad days
'Fore I knew what cash flow meant,Seems everybody's joggin' or heavy into health shit
Don't tell me that I ought to get rolfed
'Cause I love cajun martinis and playin' afternoon golf,Chorus:
We are the people there isn't any doubt
We are the people they still can't figure out
We are the people who love to sing ""Twist and Shout""

Then we landed in the water, just about my favorite thrill
When some asshole started firing as we taxied to Negril,Just about to lose my temper as I endeavored to explain

We were not some coked up cowboys sporting guns and alibis,chorus,They shot from the lighthouse
They shot from the highway
They shot from the top of the cliff

The principal singer is the Governor of the island, and the key characters of the show sing verses about the history.,Narrator
Kinja was the name of the island when it was British. The actual name was King George The Third Island, but the islanders shortened that to Kinja. Now the name in the maps and the guidebooks is Amerigo, but everybody who still lives there still calls it Kinja. The United States acquired the island peaceably in 1940 as part of the shuffling of old destroyers and Caribbean real estate that went on between Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill. The details of the transaction were and are vague to the inhabitants. The West Indian is not exactly hostile to change, but he's not much inclined to believe in it. Meantime in a fashion Amerigo is getting Americanized. The inflow of cash is making everyone more prosperous. Most Kinjans go along cheerily with this explosion of American energy in the Caribbean. To them it seems like a new harmless and apparently endless Carnival.,Sanders

I remember the smell of the creosote plant
When we'd have to eat on Easter with my crazy old uncle and aunt
They lived in a big house, antebellum style (antebellum)
And the winds would blow across the old bayou
And I was a tranquil little child,Chorus:
Life was just a tire swing
'Jambalaya' was the only song I could sing
Blackberry pickin', eatin' fried chicken
And I never knew a thing about pain
Life was just a tire swing,In a few summers my folks packed me off to camp
Yeah me and my cousin' Baxter in our pup tent with a lamp
And in a few days Baxter went home and he left me by myself
But I knew that I'd stay, it was better that way
And I could get along without any help,Chorus:

'Jambalaya' was the only song I could sing
Chasin' after sparrows with rubber-tipped arrows
Knowin' I could never hurt a thing
Life was just a tire swing (tire swing),And I never been west of New Orleans or east of Pensacola
My only contact with the outside world was an RCA Victrola,And Elvis would sing and then I'd dream about expensive cars
And who would've figured twenty years later
I'd be rubbin' shoulders with the stars
Life was just a tire swing,Then the other mornin' on some Illinois road
I fell asleep at the wheel
But was quickly wakened up by a 'Ma Bell' telephone pole
And a bunch of Grant Wood faces screamin' ""Is he still alive?""
Through the window I could see it hangin' from a tree
And I knew that I had survived,And life is still a tire swing
'Jambalaya' is the best song I can sing

Then they'll mothball the whole damn fleet
We'll only have the picture books
Of land, and sea, and foam,'Cause they're sendin' the old man home,He'll only have his memories
Or great books by James Jones

For Hoagy Carmichael
You never try to keep the wild ones home
But mister don't just sit there and wait
Go out on the town makin' all of the rounds
It don't matter if you're your own date,(Aah, aah, ah, ah ah ah)
(Aah, aah, ah, ah ah ah)
Vacantly occupied, sat on the beach 'til my body got fried
Dreamin' of your pretty eyes up in South Carolina
I can't pronounce my r's or g's when I'm speakin' Southernese
Honey do, honey come and do me again,I've seen your fat cat style
Three hundred pounds of jive ass smile
Young girls gigglin' all the while
That's not my cup of chowder,I go for candlelight
Cold champagne nearly every night
Honey do, a little toast for me and you,Honey (honey) why couldn't you have taken the non-stop train
I'm hungry (hungry) and I really want to see you again,I know it's gettin' late
Waiter keeps starin' at your empty plate
Maitre'd keeps tellin' me
""Uh Sir, she's just not coming"",Now what the hell does garcon know
We've been through all this befo'
Honey do, honey come and do me again,-- Spoken: ""Alright Blues Torpedoes"",(sax solo),Honey (honey) why couldn't you have taken the non-stop train

At 31, 000 feet
I'm gonna fly on out of here
On wings that you can't see
If you're gonna fly high without fear
You're gonna have to learn to love the atmosphere
And you gotta learn to use those wings
That you can't see,I been shreddin' on the mountains of the moon
On a weekend whim
I been looking out for life on Mars
Ground control to Major Jim
All these things could be yours too
If you'd just take another point of view
Everybody's got a pair of wings that they can't see,I've got wings that you can't see
I have wheels on my feet
Way up high I feel free
On these wings you can't see,I don't need no runway, I got fuel here in my bong
I can buzz at treetop flyer level all day long
Now I'm looking down on tiny cars
Tiny swimmers in the water
And tiny beach bars
And all because of these wings that you can't see,I've got wings that you can't see
I have wheels on my feet
Way up high I feel free
On these wings you can't see,Maybe if you open up your mind
You might learn some things
God only knows what you might find
Floatin' on those wings
You can try to fly away from all your problems
Well I'm here to say
That ain't the way to solve them
I can only help you with wings
That you can't see,We have wings that we can't see
We have wheels on our feet
Way up high we'll be free
On these wings we can't see,You have wings look and see
Silver wings like Merle and me
Come up up to Cloud 9B
Come on take a little taste of freedom
High up in a cloudland kingdom
Take a little trip on wings that you can't see"

I might never come back again,I studied the language tapes
And I, I read all the books
Still nothing prepared me for my
Very first look,Chorus:
It was my first look
Baby that's all it took
Was my first look
Around,I think I want to go flyin'
But I don't wanna leave the ground
So I'll just cruise on my landing gear
And taxi 'round Rio town
Up to the mountain, down to the sea
Take me to Leblon where the samba queen a-waits for me,Chorus:

For Mac who reminds me of me seven years ago,In the middle of late last night I was sittin' on a curb
I didn't know what about, but I was feelin' quite disturbed
A street sweeper came whistlin' by, he was bouncin' every step
It seemed strange how good he felt, so I asked him while he swept,Chorus:
He said, ""It's my job to be cleaning up this mess
And that's enough reason to go for me
It's my job to be better than the rest
And that makes a day for me."",I got an uncle who owns a bank, he's a self-made millionaire
He never had anyone to love, never had no one to care
He always seemed kinda sad to me and I asked him why that was
And he told me it's because in my contract there's this clause,Chorus:
That says, ""It's my job to be worried half to death
And that's the thing people respect in me
It's my job but without it I'd be less
Than what I expect from me."",Now I've been lazy most all my life writin' songs and sleepin' late
And any manual labor I've done was purely by mistake
If street sweepers can smile then I've got no right to feel upset
But sometimes I still forget
'Til the lights go on and the stage is set
And the song hits home and you feel that sweat,Chorus:
It's my job to be different than the rest
And that's enough reason to go for me
It's my job to be better than the rest
And that's a rough break for me,It's my job to be cleaning up this mess
And that's enough reason to go for me
It's my job to be better than the rest
And that makes the day for me,- Notes:

Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo

Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom

Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe

Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube),[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido,[Puente: Luis Fonsi]
Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
I can move forever cuando esté contigo
¡Bailalo!,[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi & Justin Bieber]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (D.Y.)
Despacito"

Ask me what's my best side
I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with
Feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But, the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So, I know we got issues, baby
True, true, true
But, I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new

See I never thought that I could walk through fire,I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return
And there's just no turning back,When your heart's under attack,Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never
I will fight,I will fight 'til forever

Whenever you knock me down,I will not stay on the ground

I gotcha lil bro, I can handle him
Hold up, aight? I can handle him
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arm's a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be tryna chill
They be trying to side with the thrill
No pun intended
Was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the Force
If push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the fourth
Ice water in blood
I gotta be the best, and yes we're the fliest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land
I will never say never
I will fight
I will fight 'til forever
To make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, up, up, up
And never say never

Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something

I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living,See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did,You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way,So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone,You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs,So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone,You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving,So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach,And you bless me with the best gift

Yeah, you've given me purpose,Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent
my spirit's at ease,I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach,And you've given me the best gift

You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way,Oh, you are my everything

We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions,You can't be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that's not who you are. You know you're trying to be the best you can be, but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening,That's what happening with me, it's like ""God, I'm giving it all I've got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm going to do it.""

Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open

She ain't gotta heart or a ass, just her brains, gotta ask cause her ass on a learning curve
And she love to earn the verb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctors note
Real deep pockets like a doctors clothes
Stay fitted like Diddy, hair back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate wanna rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock & roll
She say ""I know, honey bunny that's a funny thing""
Watch her twerk for a goodfella
She money dance with the money team
IGH!,Oh no no, oh no no

Tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky past the moon to the galaxy
As long as you're with me, baby,Honestly (honestly) with the strength of our love
We can't go nowhere but up
It's a big big world,And I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh
From every ocean that we're swimmin' in,We can make the sun shine in the moon light
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard
Baby, believe me, ooh
That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can't go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear

We can't go nowhere but up
Nowhere but up,Baby, we were underground
We're on the surface now
We're gonna make it girl
I promise
If you believe in love
And you believe in us
We can't go nowhere but up
We can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can't go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear

How many promises, be honest girl
How many tears you let hit the floor?,How many bags you packed, just to take him back
Tell me that how many either ors

To fight with time and space

See like Adam and Eve

Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,And I ain't with it.
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,Reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment

About a girl and a boy
He fell in love for his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken,And it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?,You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy
I'm here to see you smile,I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love,But you can't fly unless you lets ya
You can't fly unless you lets ya, so fall
Well I can tell you're afraid of,What this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship
And that you don't wanna lose,Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stay
Sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel?,Who forgot how to fly
Did you know that it breaks my heart
Every time to see you cry
Cause I know that it pains if he's gone,Every time you don't know
On the shoulder you're crying
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out
Who's gonna make you fall in love,I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you lets ya
You can't fly unless you lets ya, so fall
I will catch you if you fall,I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings,You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you lets ya
You can't fly unless you lets ya, so fall,Who's gonna make you fall in love

Would you lie to me, baby?
'Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?,Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is...,If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms

So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl,(Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, alright)

But sure is worth a try,Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
'Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this a lesson
Baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you,Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish

Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know, girl
We both know it's a cruel world,But I will take my chances ...hey...
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love, love, love me,As long as you love, love, love, love me (love me) ohhh

Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You can be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand,As long as you love me

Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly to yah
I'll beat you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust...
A couple of things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we are on top of the world, that's just how we do
Used to tell me, ""Sky's the limit"", now the sky's our point of view (view)
Man now we stepping out like, ""Whoa"" (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot (shoot)
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me,We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke

I'll be your platinum (platinum), I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now,Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out,He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt,Life is worth living,Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in,Life is worth living again,Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow,Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead,Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt,Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness,People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again,What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see,They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me,Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again"

I would still..
and my net froze
I told her I was hot
She told me that she cold
We are a tornado so we spin across the globe
I make money every day
and everybody surely knows
I'm a rich boy
a young pretty guy
She's pretty fly
She's pretty high
We're high together
Make change whether (x2)
Hopes and I love her,[Justin Bieber],She's a rich girl
Buying all the clothes
Wrst full of gold

I've been thinking about you all day long,
hoping you pick up your phone,And I know that I don't wanna lose your love,
oh baby, oh baby, oh baby,Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low,Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart is breaking
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause girl my heart is breaking,Girl you see me standing here
Standing in the rain

'Cause girl my heart is breaking (heart is breaking),So what I'm really trying to say is, and what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around
But, this is, this is personal, this is, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And I know the seasons may change
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
But I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name
And you know I don't wanna lose that,(I still believe)
I still believe in love
I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us
The way I believe in us,You don't see, 'cause what you don't see, is when we don't speak
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feelin'
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I, the way that I,You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time can someone call a referee?
Cause I just nee one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me oh let me redeem oh redeem of myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances, yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm, missing more than just your body, ohhh

Quisiera regresar el tiempo y cambiar errores
Sé que todo fue mi culpa y te causé dolores
Espero que de volver tú tengas intenciones
Porque hoy estoy aquí extrañándote
Ok, tu por mi morías, ma'
No solo física, había química
Yo te llamaba y no querías contestar
Sé que fui tonto y no te supe valorar,Entiende mi estilo de vida
Por favor comprende,Que esto no pasó de repente
Si está en mi mano no lo dejo a la suerte,Solo espero que me perdones
Nena, tengo tantas ganas de amarte,Solo quiero que me perdones,Así tú y yo podremos estar
Olvida todo no voy a fallar,I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh no, no)
Cause I'm, missing more than just your body (your body)

About a girl and a boy
She fell in love for his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken
And it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy
I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while,Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless he lets ya
You can't fly unless he lets ya, so fall,Well I can tell you're afraid of
What this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship
And that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stay
Sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel?
Who forgot how to fly
Did you know that it breaks my heart
Every time to see you cry
Cause I know that it pains if he's gone
Every time you don't know
On the shoulder you're crying
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out,Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless he lets ya
You can't fly unless he lets ya, so fall,I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless he lets ya
You can't fly unless he lets ya, so fall,Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless he lets ya
You can't fly unless he lets ya, so fall

Damn damn J.B, where the hell you been
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds
2 big face Rollies, no I aint lyin
Making momma so proud that she cryin
Yeah you say Im crazy? Guess that makes two
But I never knew that dreams really came true
Started playing drums, when I was only 2
Now we kick it in Japan, kung-fu
So Im heading for the gold, Im sweating
I swear Otis Redding will be oh-so ready
I already got ahead-y of the game, Im with Kenny
And we steady getting many, I mean money
Riding in an all-black Benz with the all black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses,WaitIm not done,[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I thanked Jesus at the awards Im never going to hell
Call me Zack Morris Im saving you by the bell
My girl says Im perfect she just loves them perfect persons
Perfectly personally I think she is perfectly perfect
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me
Swear that I got honey bees cause baby Im a money tree
So be my little honey bee my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y
Possibly your probly thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally
Theres a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out I should make history
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory
Cant you see the private jets flying over you?
I aint even notice but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no they shouldnt be a photoshoot
Its funny how you wanna take my picture and its like your first time
Playing with camera claiming that Its not mine
Just calm down, you dont gotta hurry
Dont be nervous, you dont gotta worry
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them Id be blurry"

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do

I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not

I'm giving you all my love

Still looking up,I won't give up on us (no, I'm not giving up)

and get dress up in clothes we don't mind getting messed up,When no one would know how to get us
We don't need the map we'll just drive drive drive
I wanna get lost with you
and hideout out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
and see what it's like to spend the whole night,With you just you
With you just you
With you just you
With you just you.,We could head North over the ocean of turquoises
Well after a while there'll be no noise
Set for the sound of our heartbeats beats and on
and we'll stand in the Grand here alone
Singing our favorite songs
and wait for the words to return to the echo echo echo,I wanna get lost with you
and hideout out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
and see what it's like to spend the whole night,With you just you

You're the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you're needy
Humble but you're greedy
Based on your body language
And shouted cursive I've been reading
Your style is quite selective
But your mind is rather reckless
Well I guess it just suggests
that this is just what happiness is,Hey what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses,Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And don't mind my nerve you can call it fiction
'But I like being submerged in your contradictions dear
'Cause here we are, here we are,Although you are biased I love your advice
Your comebacks they're quick
And probably have to do with your insecurities
There's no shame in being crazy
Depending on how you take these
Words they're paraphrasing this relationship we're staging,And it's a beautiful mess yes it is
It's like, we're picking up trash in dresses,Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And kind and courteous is a life I've heard
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt, ohh dear
'Cause here we are, Here we are
Here we are, Here we are
Here we are, Here we are...
Here we are, We're still here,And what a beautiful mess this is
It's like taking a guess when the only answer is yes
And through timeless words
And priceless pictures
We'll fly like birds
Not of this earth
And tides they turn
and hearts disfigure
But that's no concern
When we're wounded together
And we've tore our dresses
And stained our shirts
But it's nice today
Oh the wait was so worth it"

Cause I don't mind being anybody's clown

In an altruistic way,Cause basically this place is needing instruments of harmony
Spreading my philosophy of love and inspiration
Oh these words I speak I commit to like a crime

Through a looking glass
And see her as a carbon atom
See her eyes and stare back at them
See that girl
As her own new world
Though a home is on the surface, she is still a universe,Glory God, oh God is peeking through the blinds
Are we all here standing naked
Taking guesses at the actual date and time
Oh my, justifying reasons why
Is an absolutely insane resolution to live by,Live high, live mighty
Live righteously
Takin' it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously,I try to picture the man
To always have an open hand
And see him as a giving tree
See him as matter
Matter fact he's not a beast
Oh no not the devil either
Always a good deed doer
And it's laughter that we're making after all,The call of the wild is still an ordination why
And the order of the primates
All our politics are too late
Oh my, the congregation in my mind
Is this assembly singing of gratitude
Practicing their lovin' for you,Live high, live mighty
Live righteously
Takin' it easy
Live high, live mighty
Oo. live righteously,And sing it out
And just take it easy
And celebrate the malleable reality
You see nothing is ever as it seems
Yeah, this life is but a dream,Live high, live high, live mighty mighty mighty, oo.
Live righteously
And takin' it easy,Live high, live mighty
Ooh. live righteously
Just take, just just, take it easy,Live high, live mighty mighty
Live righteously
Takin' it easy,Live high, live mighty

Open up your door

And the birdies sing

And all of nature deserves to be

And be like me
Open up your door

But the absence of the light is a necessary part.

There is always a hand that you can hold on to.
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that your home's inside of you.,Just know, that wherever you go

You know nothing
Well you and I
Why, we go carrying on for hours, on and
We get along much better
Than you and your boyfriend,Well all I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me,How long, can I go on like this
Wishing to kiss you
Before I rightly explode?
Well this double life I lead isn't healthy for me
In fact it makes me nervous
If I get caught I could be risking it all,Cause maybe there's a lot that I miss

And I will find a way to you if it kills me

If it kills me,If I should be so bold
I'd ask you to hold my heart in your hand
I'd tell you from the start how I longed to be your man
But I never said a word
I guess I gonna miss my chance again,Well all I really wanna do is love you

It could be love
And we could be homies
And once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely
Oh, we could take it slowly
And we could keep it lowkey
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely,[Verse 1]
I've been chasing summer around
Searching for the sunshine looking for a good time
Following the good vibes
Listening to intuition when it's happening
Diggin' into life cause at times it can be saddening
Yeah, it could be a grey day
If you're lonely
A little rain suddenly turns heavy
But a whole lot of love can make the clouds go away
Maybe the time for us is now,[Pre-Chorus]
When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else,[Chorus]
It could be love
And we could be homies
And once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely
Oh, we could take it slowly
And we could keep it lowkey
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely,[Hook]

Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you unlonely,[Verse 2]
I give you my work although I'm making words up
Unlonely ain't a word, but I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm fresh form the farm where critics can't bother me
Living is tricky as it is so that ain't stoppin' me
You and me, we both agree
That no one needs the scruity
All we want is peace and love, and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile, and your style continuity,I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say:
Hey! We should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Oh, maybe just be ourselves, never phony.
Never second guessing the freindship connection
Parallel living, never in possesion of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of
Love,[Chorus]
We could be homies
And once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely
Oh, we could take it slowly
And we could keep it lowkey
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely,[Hook]
Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you unlonely
Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you unlonely,[Bridge]
When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else
If you're spending time alone
If it's just you and your phone
Taking pictures of yourself
Baby, maybe I can help,[Chorus]
It could be love
We could be homies
And once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely
Oh, we could take it slowly
And we could keep it lowkey
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely,[Hook]
Love, la-la-la, love
Love, la-la, love
One and only, I could make you unlonely,It could be love
We could be homies (Love, la-la-la, love)
And once you get to know me (Love, la-la, love)
I could be your one and only
I could make you unlonely"

Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend

You better take it from a geek like me
Well, I can save you from unoriginal dum-dums
Who wouldn't care if you complete him or not
So what I've got, a short attention span, a coke in my hand
Because I'd rather have the afternoon, relaxin' understand
My hip hop and flip-flops, well, it don't stop with the light rock
My shot to mock, you kinda puts me in the tight spot
The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha, so I'm
Developing a language and I'm callin' it my own
So take a peek into the speaker and you'll see what I mean
That on the other side the grass is greener
I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want
I could be the one to take you home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down

To farthest reaches of the beach and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars
A cosmic fish they love to kiss
They're giving birth to constellation
No riffs and oh no reservation
If they should fall you'd get a wish or dedication
May I suggest you get the best

Oh bella do what you do

Tiding the ebb and flows of hunger
You're dancing naked there for me
You expose all memory
You make the most of boundary
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love
You are the queen and king combining everything
Intertwining like a ring around the finger of a girl
I'm just a singer, you're the world
All I can bring ya
Is the language of a lover
Bella luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon-a
How you swoon me like no other
May I suggest you get the best
Of your wish may I insist
That no contest for little you or smaller IA larger chance at what all that may lie
On the rise, on the brink of our lives

Come on along, I know you really want to feel our song

Cause it brings me freedom (Freedom), woah

Other people's houses and not mine.
Some days the clouds paint the sky all gray
And it takes away my summertime.
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,
While I struggle to get mine.
If there's a light in everybody,
Send out your ray of sunshine.,I want to walk the same roads as everybody else, Through the trees and past the gates.
Getting high on heavenly breezes,
Making new friends along the way.
I won't ask much of nobody,
I'm just here to sing along.
And make my mistakes looks gracious,
And learn some lessons from my wrongs.,Well sometimes the sun shines on
Other people's houses and not mine.
Some days the clouds paint the sky all gray
And it takes away my summertime.
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,
While I struggle to get mine.
A little light never hurt nobody,
Send out your ray of sunshine.,Oh, if this little light of mine
Combined with yours today,
How many watts could we luminate?
How many villages could we save?,And my umbrella's tired of the weather,
Wearing me down.
Well, look at me now.,You should look as good as your outlook,
Would you mind if I took some time,
to soak up your light, your beautiful light?
You've got a paradise inside.
I get hungry for love and thirsty for life,
And much too full on the pain,
When I look to the sky to help me
And sometimes it looks like rain.,As the sun shines on other people's houses
And not mine,
And the sky paints those clouds in a way
That it takes away the summertime,
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,
while I kindly stand by.
If theres a light in everybody,
Send out your ray of sunshine,You're undeniably warm, you're cerulean,
You're perfect in desire.
Won't you hang around
so the sun, it can shine on me,
And the clouds they can roll away,
And the sky can become a possibility?
If there's a light in everybody,
Send out your ray of sunshine."

Wondering how the hell you are today,'Cause as carefree as you came to me

And you being there for me
For many moons I reminisce

And what do we think we might see?

'Cause I've heard them calling my name

Though I smile when it happens

It means there's a God somewhere, and he's laughing

Pour a cup of liquid gold, because my enginge's still cold

A reflection of yes's and that ever changing sky
But why do bad dreams linger long after I awake?
I don't need no scenes of violence or pain replayed
And I feel quite foolish sometimes when I pray

Looks like Jesus and His friends involved
There's a party getting started in the yard
And there's a couple getting steamy in the car, parked in the drive
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?,And by the pool that night, apparently
The chemicals weren't mixed properly
You hit your head and then forgot your name
Then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
And now your altitude and memory's a shame,What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence, I haven't had enough
It's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I'd like to believe it was all about love for a child,When the house was left in shambles
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around?
Well, I'm far too old to care about that now,What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence, I haven't had enough
It's probably because when you're young
It's okay to be easily ignored
I'd like to believe it was all about love for a child,It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
And they never checked to see my grades
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now,What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
With a little bit more of innocence, I haven't had enough
It's probably because when you're young

Your trampoline has got holes in it but I can still see the top
Let me climb aboard and sample some of next year's fashion
I'll wear the coat if you can put the hat on, I will wear the coat,
Just let me clear my throat so I can say what's been delayed aways,Let me fall into your lap and just lay here for awhile
Satisfied by your seduction like a handshake would do the job
Never know how long I have waited, anticipated your smile to be pressed against mine
Your smile pressed against mine, your smile pressed against mine
I feel it, well I feel it (oh boy)
Well I feel it and I'm gonna settle tight,She could pour me over this sugar hill or mountain
Until I get that cool breeze, tight squeeze, I'd do it over again
And I drink from her ever flowing fountain
And then I wake up I comb my hair and I hurry it up
But I arrive late I pack my things and I pick it up
Well I put down a good amount of deodorant this morning
And I found that I could drown a little bit of peace of mind
Cause it's no secret that to some degree they're gonna have to see you sweat
Strong enough for a man just do what you can to keep me soft and dry, I stink awhile,I don't know anything about those things
I almost don't wanna know anything about those things
And I don't care anything about those things
Cause if I did you know I'd share myself on those things, and I feel it,And I'll be here all night, I'll pick up the pieces and I put them back together now
They may not be the right way but that's okay as long as they're all the same
I wish you well that you'd get better, and I know you'll find that it's a wild world
And if you had noticed well would you have thrown the towel in
Before I missed out on all this love, and watch me roll away again
Watch me disappear under my skin
I don't believe it that things could get any worse than they did that time
You must have seen it I mean how could we get lost running in a straight line
Your cries of why's and why not's, may it all get back to you
And trickle and dance upon your headaches, years of biting cheeks are through
So I don't believe in it.,But I feel it."

Half of a man, half magician
Half a politician holding the mic
Like ammunition
And my vision is as simple as light.,Ain't no reason we should be in a fight
No demolition

I do not know who is calling

That we never know really,I'm tryin' to keep with the Joneses
While waiting for guns and the roses
To finish what we all suppose is
Gonna be the shit, well sue me
Oh, fist like pumpin and wrist lock,Twisting up a rizla
Kid Icarus on the transister
Nintendo been givin' me the blister
I bend over take it in the kisser

I do not eat unless it's fixed with
Some kind of sweet like a licorice
My home is deep inside the mystics
I'm known to keep diggin on existence
I'm holdin' in the heat like a fishstick
And my phone it beeps because I missed it.
I do not answer the call if,I do not know who is calling
I'm making no sense of it all
Say can I get a witness
I'm only a boy in a story,Just a hallucinatory
Trippin' on nothing there is
Living in the wilderness
With a tiger spot on my back,Living life of a cat
I just wanna relax here
And rap another rap tune
Driving off on your blind man's bike
You can say just what you like
Oh nothing can stop you
Good Job,Get 'em up way high
Gimme gimme that high five

And sing my thank yous to each and every moment of my life.
I go where I know the love is and let it feel me up inside
Gathering new strength from sorrow,
I'm glad to be alive.,Things are looking up.
I know above the clouds the sun is shining.
Things are looking up.
Love is still the answer I'm relying on.,Three little things.
Things are looking up.,Yeah the third thing that I do now when my world caves in,
is I pause I take a breath and bow and I let that chapter end.
I design my future bright not by where my life has been.
And I try, try, try, try, try again.
Yes I try, try, try, try, try again.,Things are looking up.

If I wasn't a songbird

If I wasn't a fly on the wall
I wouldn't know all about you,I'm everything in everywhere
Can you see me in your own reflection?
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between
I'm everywhere
I'm reaching out in every direction
I believe I'm in the water too
'cause you act just like you need me
I'm everywhere,If I wasn't the fire
how could you stoke me up inside?
If I wasn't a party
how could you be the life of me?
If I wasn't a camera
how could you be so photogenic? Yeah I said it
If I wasn't the hands on the clock
how could you know that the time was right, tonight?,I'm everything in everywhere

I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between
I'm everywhere
I'm reaching out in every direction
I believe I'm in the water too
'cause you act just like you need me,I got a mind like a spy on a satellite checking you out
I'm like a fly with my infinite eyes
I can see with all my senses and I'm coming to get you
I'm invisible, expendable
and omnipresent,I'm everywhere
can you see me in your own reflection?
I'm deep within the molecules of the air that you breathe
And all the subatomic supersonic spaces in between
I'm everywhere
I'm reaching out in every direction
I believe I'm in the water too

You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night.
You see, it was my fault. Of course it was mine.,I'm too hard at work.
Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your life?
I'm sorry for wasting your time.,Who am I to say this situation isn't great?
When it's my job to make the most of it
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me.
Not that easy.,Hey. What's that you say?
You're not blaming me for anything.
Well, that's great, but I don't break that easy.
Does it fade away?,So, that's why I'm ... I'm apologizing now
For telling you I thought that we could make it
I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed.,See who am I to say this situation isn't great?
It is my time to make the most of it
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me.
Not that easy, no.
No, no no.,If all along the fault is up for grabs,
Why can't she have it?
If it's for sale, what is your offer?
I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for.
Pay no more than absolutely zero.,Well, neither one of us deserves the blame,
Because opportunities moved us away.
It's not an easy thing to learn to play
A game that's made for two--that's you and me.
The rules remain a mystery.
See how it's easy?,So, who am I to say this situation isn't great?
When it's our time to make the most of it,
How could we ever know that this would happen to me?
Not that easy, no.
No ...,When all along the fault is up for grabs, and there you have it.
Well, it's for sale--go make your offer.
Will I sell it for no less than what I bought it for me?

Or sing out to protest, and to project, and to harmonize with birds
Whether it's your birthday or your dying day
It's a celebration too
Rejoice to use your voice and give wings to any of choice
Whatever you're choosing right now, it's right where... where you are
You don't need a vacation when there's nothing to escape from,Set your vibration and undulation to the hightest it can go

He's building up a shine but he take it slow
And he knows it's time to make a change here, in time to get away
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons and time to end the pain,But he sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
Why don't we sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over,She said, uh ""What would your mother think of all this, and how would your father

Oh, what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
Oh, recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
Going nowhere but for us, nowhere but the two of us
And we knew it was time to take a chance here
And time to compromise our lives just a little while
And it was time for all the wrong and lonely, lonesome reasons,But time is often on my side but I give it to you tonight
And we sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over,Why don't we sleep all, we sleep all day, we sleep all day, we sleep all day over
and over and over and over again
And as time goes by we get a little bit tired of waking and baked another Marlboro
mile wide
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in the hot summer sun
To swim beneath over outside, still they're reading between the lines
But they remember the part in the Hallmark card where they read about the dreams
And the reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
Say they knew it was time, time to take, take love
Time to take a chance here,Time to compromise to occupy their lives
And it was time for all the wrong reasons, oh,But time is often on my side but I give it to you, oh boy
Sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
So why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over and

""Would he take it all back what they've done?""
No way, they said ""Take it, take it, take it"" He said ""Make it, don't break it with
your own two hands""
See that was my old man and he said
""If all, all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it""
Love go make a mountain, go on and on and on and on
But you should go on make a mountain out of it
And hey love go on and go on and go on and
Go on and make a mountain, go on and make a mountain
Go on oh you should go on and make a mountain out of it"

Will never believe how you tackled the thousand puzzle pieces
And you could see it before we completed it
Before we made it whole
How you put it all together with a blindfold
You're like a long game token that keeps the game goin'
But your claim to fame is how you like to lay low
Out of the lime light
Which can hurt your eyes
If you're not careful you'll become another devil in disguise
But you watch your back

You're growing eyes in the back of your head
To prevent another sneak attack

You must be keepin' secret weapons in your fanny pack
You're like my laughing gas

You're like Lance on a mountain in the Tour de France

You got gold
And you're teaching us to let go
You're a wise old owl when you're the cats meow

And a super hero cape on
You see the future as a sky full of possibility
With a spryness of mind and a psychic ability
You probably won't die at the hands of an enemy
And not in a den of inequity
You're not the average Joe
You're not the average Jane
You're not above or below
But you're never just plain
You never take no, personally
And any time you get stopped you try another way
Could we settle for a kiss without a cease and desist
If they ask we won't tell 'cause we're activists
I am that I am and you are that you are
And we're all that is

When you circumnavigating the turntable call and attracts
Like you be jumpin' in the water you be makin' a splash
You be keepin' your heart beat going
And you be keepin' the harmony going
Well there's an awful lot of musical styles you could play
Well there's an awful lot of tastes
An awful lot of dates you could be on
You be keepin' your back bone strong
And you be keepin' the trombone blowin'
Well every friend of mine will give each other high-fives

You do what you like and you always like what you try
You touch me like an i

Move me like a smooth jazz music station
Do what you do in the way that you choose to do them
Oh my God

Creo que es de nuevo mi turno para ganar algo o aprender algo,No dudaré en no más
No más, no puede esperar soy tuyo
Bueno abre tu mente y mira como yo
Abre tus planes y diablos eres libre
Mira en tu corazón y encontrarás amor amor amor amor
Escucha la música del pueblo momento bailar y cantar,Estamos a sólo una gran familia
Es su dios abandonado derecho a ser amado, querido, amado, amado
Por lo tanto, no dudaré en no más,No más, no puedo esperar estoy seguro
No hay necesidad de complicar nuestro tiempo es corto
Este es nuestro destino, soy tuyo
-d-do hacer usted, pero ¿verdad, dd-do, pero quieres venir uno
Scooch uno sobre cerca querida y voy a picar la oreja
Bap woooooo bap bap ho ho ooooh,He pasado ""demasiado tiempo comprobando 'mi lengua en el espejo
Y flexión 'hacia atrás sólo para tratar de verlo más claro
Mi aliento empaña el vidrio
Y así que dibujé una nueva cara y me reí
Supongo que lo que estoy diciendo una de que no hay mejor razón,Para librarse de la vanidad y sólo tiene que ir con las estaciones
Es lo que pretendemos hacer
Nuestro nombre es nuestra virtud,No dudaré en no más
No más, no puede esperar soy tuyo
Bueno abre tu mente y mira como yo,Abre tus planes y diablos eres libre
Mira en tu corazón y encontrarás que el cielo es tuyo
Así que por favor no lo hagas, no por favor, no lo hagas
(No hay necesidad de complicarse)
Porque nuestro tiempo es corto
Esto es, esto es, este es nuestro destino
Soy tuyo"

I'm sitting alone again
I'm staring up at the sky
Which at this lonely moment is my only friend
And suddenly as I gazed upon the night
Well I notice the stars
They began to shake and dance and burst
And fall into the darkness
They exploded down
I knew what I had to do
I ran up to the top of the hill
And I took ahold for you
You were the sweetest star that fell
And yes, I held onto it close
To the numbness in my heart,And then I kissed a star
Yes I did
I wrapped it up inside of a golden bow
And then I ran away
Just to find you
'Cause this was your gift
Your gift
Oh shit
A star that I kissed
Oh the galaxy that lives inside your eyes
Was in need
I said it was in need
Of a, of a brand new shining light
I said I wished to the dark sky above
That all I had was to be captured
And willingly turned over to you
I know you better now
And at this I smile
I simply gave to you
The symbol of what you are to me
You are the star that shines
And explodes with light
And I love and embrace
Love and embrace all that I can
You better take this blindess and stay away from me
And let me bask inside of your golden seam
I never knew such simple astronomy
I never knew it could come to me
And not by the ways of the heart,And call on me
To be one of those strangely dressed wise men
Who follow the stars to their love
You are such a perfect star to wish upon
Well I love you and god and I'm hopeful
Of what this lonely night may lead me to
So I said, God I'm hopeful
Of what this lonely, lonely night
Will lead me tonight
Oh well, well i'm hopeful that this lonely night
Well it shines so right
I'm hopeful
I'm hopeful of all good things
To come about
I'm wishing upon you now
Yeah, I'm wishing upon you now,Free me and let me indulge my view
Oh most beautiful you
Keeper of starlight
Take on me
Oh, oh, oh
Well here I am
I'm sitting all by myself again
I stare up at the sky
Which at this moment is my only friend
Say well, suddenly as I gazed upon the night
Well i notice the stars
They began to shake and burst
Oh it looks like they want to fight, no
They were dancing
They were romancing
Oh, they were falling in love
They falling in love all over
Falling in love all over
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I say falling in love, falling in love all over
Falling in love, is my best friend
Falling in love all over,
All over again"

Just living, no business at all
There was something to this man
Who had seen it all
He wasn't looking for a handout
He didn't want my money neither
Just tired of speaking to the wall
Said everybody needs to talk,Whoa oh oh,Chorus,I'm coming to your rescue

Too young to have that kind of voice

You were green in the eyes and still shining like you do all the time,
And I asked you why
Is it because of the cola that you lost control and your hands are cold
You're standing like a walk in the park,And sometimes I like a meanie but it's probably reason why I do

With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt.
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert.
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt.
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.,I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking.
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking.
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken.
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way.,On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down.,In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging.
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing.
Then I headed down the street,
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing,
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.,On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound

And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze.,Now I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left he went and named me Sue.,Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke
An' it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
Seems I had to fight my whole life through.,Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.,Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame.,But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man that gave me that awful name.,Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew.,In an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue.,Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye.,He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said
""My name is Sue! How do you do? Now you gonna die!""
Yeah! That's what I told him.,Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece o' my ear.,I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kickin' and a gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer.,I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.,Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.,And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along.,So I gave you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong.""
Yeah! He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and ya got the right
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do.
But you oughta thank me before I die
For the gravel in your gut and the spit in the eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue.""
Yeah, what could I do? What COULD I do?
I got all choked up and threw down my gun
Called him my pa and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view.
And I think about him now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George, anything but Sue! I still hate that name!"

But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died,Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short never to go again

Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound,And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again

An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come,Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side

If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife,Now she walks these hills, in a long black veil
She visits my grave, when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me
Nobody knows, nobody sees

Why you never see bright colors on my back,
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.,I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
But is there because he's a victim of the times.,I wear the black for those who never read,
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.,Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.,I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.,And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side.,Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
You'll never see me wear a suit of white.,Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
And tell the world that everything's OK,
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,
'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black."

An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black,One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand,I'd get it one piece at a time and it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style, I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is a round,So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years,The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home,Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53 and the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone,So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an adapter kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on,The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said, ""Honey, take me for a spin"",So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds,I got it one piece at a time and it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style, I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around,Uh yow, Red Ryder, this is the cotton mouth
In the Psycho-Billy Cadillac come on, huh, this is the cotton mouth
And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Uh, what model is it?,Well, it's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56
'57, '58' 59' automobile

Made a good run but I ran too slow

In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty heck that shot your woman down,Said yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
Shot her down because she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more,When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail,Early next mornin' bout a half past nine
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
Ah, and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty heck into that district court,Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about,In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read murder in the first degree
I hollered Lawdy Lawdy, have a mercy on me,The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
99 years in the Folsom pen
99 years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down,Come on you've gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be"

Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around,I fly a starship across the universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can

Or I may simply be a single drop of rain

I said, ""Your old court house is kinda run down,
He said, ""Naw, it'll do for our little town"".
I said, ""Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit,
And that's a ragged old flag you got hangin' on it"".
He said, ""Have a seat"", and I sat down,
""Is this the first time you've been to our little town""
I said, ""I think it is""
He said ""I don't like to brag, but we're kinda proud of
That Ragged Old Flag,""You see, we got a little hole in that flag there,
When Washington took it across the Delaware.
and It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it,
writing ""Say Can You See""
It got a bad rip in New Orleans, with Packingham & Jackson
tugging at its seams.
and It almost fell at the Alamo
beside the Texas flag,
But she waved on though.
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville,
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill.
There was Robert E. Lee and Beauregard and Bragg,
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag,""On Flanders Field in World War I,
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun,
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two,
She was in Korea, Vietnam, She went where she was sent
by her Uncle Sam.
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
and now they've about quit wavin' back here at home
in her own good land here She's been abused,
She's been burned, dishonored, denied an' refused,
And the government for which she stands
Has scandalized throughout out the land.
And she's getting thread bare, and she's wearin' thin,
But she's in good shape, for the shape she's in.
Cause she's been through the fire before
and i believe she can take a whole lot more.,""So we raise her up every morning
And we take her down every night,
We don't let her touch the ground,
And we fold her up right.
On second thought
I *do* like to brag
Cause I'm mighty proud of
That Ragged Old Flag"""

I never would have made it through the Arkansas mud

I wrote a letter to my Uncle Thud
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud,The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud,One day I was ridin' in a beautiful land
and run smack into an Indian band
They jumped their nags with a hoop and a yell
A I rode away like a bat outta hell,I circled their camp for a time or two
just to show what the Tennessee stud could do
Them redskin boys couldn't get my blood
Cuz I was aridin' on the Tennessee Stud,refrain,Rode on down into no man's land
I crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with the Spaniards bold
'Til I got me a skinful of silver and gold,Me and a gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We jerked our guns, he fell with a thud
And I got away on the Tennessee Stud,The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud,I rode on back across Arkansas
And I whupped her brother and I whupped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was a-riding on a Tennessee Mare,Stirrup to stirrup and side by sie
We crossed the plains andthe valleys wide
Come to Big Muddy and the foot of the flood
on the Tennessee mare and the Tennessee Stud,Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
And a little horse colt playing 'round the door
I love the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare.,The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood

Who could sit at his father's right hand

Me and little brother would join right in there.
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.,Now I remember after work,
Mama would call in all of us.
You could hear us singing for a country mile.
Now little brother has done gone on.
But, I'll rejoin him in a song.
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while.,Daddy sang bass,
Mama sang tenor.
Me and little brother would join right in there.
Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul.
One of these days and it won't be long,
I'll rejoin them in a song.
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne.
Oh, no the circle won't be broken.
By and by, Lord, by and by.,Daddy sang bass,
Mama sang tenor.
Me and little brother would join right in there.
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.
In the sky, Lord, in the sky."

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war,Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian 
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land,Down the ditches for a thousand years 
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights 
And the sparklin' water stopped,Now Ira's folks were hungry 
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered 
And forgot the white man's greed,CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war,
There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill, 
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again,And when the fight was over 
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high 
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes,CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war,Ira Hayes returned a hero 
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored; Everybody shook his hand,But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done 
And when did the Indians dance,CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war,Then Ira started drinkin' hard;
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
like you'd throw a dog a bone!,He died drunk early one mornin' 
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch 
Was a grave for Ira Hayes,CHORUS:
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian 
Nor the Marine that went to war,Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes 
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty 
In the ditch where Ira died"

The Rebel - Johnny Yuma
Written by A. Fenady & R. Markowitz,Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the west
Did Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone,He got fightin' mad
This rebel lad
He packed no star
As he wandered far
Where the only law
Was a hook and a draw
The rebel, Johnny Yuma,(Repeat 1st verse),He searched the land
This restless lad
He was panther quick
And leather tough
If he figured that
He'd been pushed enough
The rebel, Johnny Yuma,(Repeat 1st verse),Fightin' mad
This rebel lad
With a dream he'd hold
'Til his dyin' breath
He'd search his soul
And gamble with death

It loads a mite slow and I soon found out

Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand,I got into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating and I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw,The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand,Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man

I met you in the shadows and your face was all aglow;
I remember it so well, though it was many years ago;
We both knew something happened without a lot to say;
But we had other lives and so we went our separate ways;
But our hearts communicated and every time we passed;
We were gradually building something that would forever last.,Verse 2
My heart was calling for you when one night you came along. We danced around each other but then we sang our song. Our harmony was shaky, and the pitch not very true. But then you gave in to me and I gave in to you. We had to fight the world and we fought with all we had. We vowed to be together through the sweet times and the bad.,Verse 3
I hear you whisper every night May I have this dance. And though I'm not light on my feet I always take the chance. We've gone through many storms and often walked through fire. But always our loving faith took us higher and higher.
We know the mystery of life; it's love hard and long.,She: I love you. He: I love you and I always will. As long...,Chorus separate and together:,As long; as long

Of a lot of things I've had
And a lot more than I needed
Of some things that turned out bad,I got side tracked in El Paso
Stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way in Pleura
With Juanita on my back,Then I went to sleep in Shreveport
Woke up in Abilene
Wonderin' why I'm wanted
At some town half way between,Wanted man in Albuquerque
Wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee
Wanted man in Baton Rouge,There's somebody set to grab me
Anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight
You might get a glimpse of me,Wanted man in California
Wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in the Kansas City
Wanted man in the Ohio,Wanted man in Mississippi
Wanted man in ol' Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight
You might see this wanted man"

Berpaling pun tak mampu hilangkan cinta percayalah,Jangan sampai hingga waktu perpisahan tiba

Mungkin saja cinta kan menghilang selamanya dan semua yang tersisa hanyalah air mata
Hanya air mata, hanya air mata, hanya air mata
