I gotta say what's on my mind
Something about us
Doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps getting in the way
Whenever we try
Somehow the plan
Is always rearranged
It's so hard to say
But I've got to do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up
And I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to gray
And it's just to hard
To watch it all
Slowly fade away
I'm leaving today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way,What about us?
What about everything we've been through?,What about trust?,You know I never wanted to hurt you,What about me?,What am I supposed to do?,I gotta leave but I'll miss you,So, I've got to move on and be who I am,Why do you have to go?,I just don't belong here,I hope you understand,I'm trying to understand,We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now,I want you to stay,I gotta go my own way,I've got to move on and be who I am,What about us?,I just don't belong here
I hope you understand,I'm trying to understand,We might find a place in this world someday (World someday)
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go-my own way"

Never felt this way
And right here tonight,This could be the start
Of something new
It feels so right
To be here with you
Oh,And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new,Now who'd of ever thought that
We'd both be here tonight?
Oh yeah
And the world looks so much brighter (brighter)
With you by my side (by my side),I know that something has changed

We just keep on getting better

Miracles could happen?

That I don't really care,I thought you were my fairy tale
A dream when I'm not sleeping
A wish upon a star
That's coming true
But everybody else could tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
When there was me and you,I swore I knew the melody
That I heard you singing
And when you smiled
You made me feel
Like I could sing along
But then you went and changed the words
Now my heart is empty
I'm only left with used-to-be's
And once upon a song,Now I know your not a fairy tale
And dreams were meant for sleeping
And wishes on a star
Just don't come true
'Cause now even I can tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
'Cause I liked the view
When there was me and you,I can't believe
That I could be so blind
It's like you were floating
While I was falling
And I didn't mind
'Cause I liked the view
I thought you felt it too
When there was me and you"

Don't panic, panic,Now do we have to dress up for the prom?
Dude I dont think we have the choice
Yeah it's the night of all nights
Gotta look just right
Dressing to impress the boys,Do I want classic or vintage or plaid?
Where's the mirror?
I think this tux is too baggy
Too tight, it makes me look weird
Should I go movie star glamorous, sassy or sweet?
Don't know, but no one better wear the same dress as me,It's the night of our nightmares
It's the night of our dreams
It's too late to back out of it, hey!
Makeovers, massages, dont know what a corsage is
Been waiting all our lives for this,It's gonna be a night, cant wait
To remember, aw man
Come on now, big fun, alright
Its gonna be the night, I guess
To last forever, lucky us
We'll never ever ever forget,Gettin' ready, get gettin' ready
Gettin' ready, get gettin' ready

So, what should I do with my hair?
Where's my shaver? Ooh, I love it
I look like a waiter, should I fluff it?

He's here, it's time, the hour's arrived
Don't know why, her father's staring me down
Where's my purse? Lip gloss?
Now I'm really freaking out
Then something changes my world
The most beautiful girl right in front of my eyes,It's gonna be a night, oh yeah!
To remember, that's for sure
Come on now, big fun, alright!
It's gonna be the night, yeah tonight
To last forever, forever more
We'll never ever ever forget,Who's that girl? She's so fine
Who's that guy? I don't recognize
Who's that girl? She looks so good, yeah
Guess you never really notice, but you probably should,Big fun, on the night of nights, alright
The night of nights, tonight
Let's dance on the night of nights
You know were gonna do it right,It's gonna be a night to remember
It's gonna be the night to last forever
It's gonna be a night to remember
It's gonna be the night to last forever, last forever,It's gonna be our night, you know it

Come on now, big fun, to remember!
Its gonna be the night, love it
To last forever, the rest of our lives
We'll never ever ever forget,It's gonna be our night, oh yeah!

We're lovin' it, come on and say okay now
What time is it? It's party time
Let's go and have the time of our lives

You don't know...,You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I, know every rock and three, and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name,You think the only people, who are people
Are you the people who look and think like you?
But if you walk the footsteps, of a stranger
You'll learn the things you never knew, you never knew,Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?,Come run the hidden pine trails, of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches, all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth (no),The rainstorm and the river are my, brothers
The heron and the otter are my, friends
And we are all connected, to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends,How high does a sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know,And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind,You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is Earth until,You can paint with all the colors of the wind

Take us as we are
Or not at all
We ain't ever gonna change ourselves for no one
No compromise
Cause its our life
It's all or nothing,Take me as I am
Or not at all
I ain't ever gonna change myself for no one
No compromise
Cause its my life
It's all or nothing"

I don't wanna lose your love,I remember the moment I first looked in your eyes
And seen nothing looking back at me, it was then I realized
That even though you were there, your heart was long gone
And I knew right then how lost I'd be before you move on,If I should lose your love, boy, shame on me

I am asking you, please, can we try this once more?
Just hold me tight, don't ever let go
And if never comes around I want you to know,I want you, I need you
Can't lose you tonight, no, no
I won't do nothing to lose you
I won't lose this fight

Straight off T.V
A style radio tuned
To all the stations,If they cheats they a.m

It's says to rock so what

Don't jock, my style
When I'm gearing up
Don't try to go skip my time
Cause' the look's so edgy and

When the beat is like an earthquake
We're unstoppable
We're uncontrollable
Just admit it, you can't stop it, it's addictive,Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
It will come easily when you hear the beat, oh
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
Basically what we're gonna do is dance
All you gotta do is take a chance
Yeah, that's right, it's sneakernight,Oh, put your sneakers on

You really caught my attention
Didn't know I was looking for a rescue
I wasn't thinking that hard
Now and then I was there in the moment
I was ready for nothing
It doesn't' mean that I really didn't love you
While I'm breaking your heart,Don't ask why
Before we get too close
Just let me say goodbye
It's easier this way
Don't ask why
Before you ask the question
And I die inside
Just let me walk away,I felt bad that I let my past hurt you
Cause I really didn't mean to
I was lost, I was lucky you found me
But it only got worse
Right now while you're looking right at me
The emotions still scare me
It doesn't mean that I really don't love you
When I'm making you hurt,Don't ask why
Before we get too close
Just let me say goodbye
It's easier this way (It's easier this way)
Don't ask why
Before you ask the question
And I die inside
Just let me walk away,And I want this more than ever
I wish there was another way
You see, my words can only hurt you
Till his shadow fades away,(Oh, oh),Don't ask why
Before we get too close
Just let me say goodbye
It's easier this way (It's easier this way)
Don't ask why
Before you ask the question

But you gotta come to me
I wanna be touched, wanna be touched (2x),I never believed in love at first sight
But you made me wanna give it a try
You won't regret it, boy if you let me in (reverb),I can be your lady, you can be my baby

I must confess, this loneliness is killing me

Nothing comes by accident

So don't leave
Don't leave,Lonely day and lonely nights
That's where you'll be without me by your side
Better think twice, baby
This could grow up crazy, you know
I can't keep singing my secret cause it's out of control
I gave you everything: body, mind, heart and soul
But you keep breaking me, taking me to another low
Don't do it baby
Don't do it
Don't let me go
I don't know
I don't know,I don't know what I do if I ever lost you

Then we saw the man from across the road
With the sunshine in his eye
Well he lived all alone, in his own little home
With a great big gallon jar
There were bottles, too, one for me and you

i wish i could find me a handy boatman
to ferry me over to my love and die.
My childhood days bring back sad reflections
of happy days so long ago.
my boyhood friends and my own relations.
have all passed on like the melting snow.
So i'll spend my days in endless roving,
soft is the grass and my bed is free.

You had the key to your soul and you did open

And as the shiver from my neck down to my spine
Ignited me in daylight and nature in the garden,And you went into a trance, your childlike vision became so fine
And we heard the bells within the church, we loved so much
And felt the presence of the youth of eternal summers in the garden,Alright, and as it touched your cheeks so lightly
Born again you were and blushed
And we touched each other lightly
And we felt the presence of the Christ

And the Father in the garden"",Listen, no guru, no method, no teacher

And by the mansion gate
We stood enraptured by the silence
As the birds sang their heavenly song
In Tir Na Nog,We stopped in the church of Ireland
And prayed to our father
And climbed up the mountainside
With fire in our hearts
And we walked all the way to Tir Na Nog,I said with my eyes that
I recognized your chin
It was my long lost friend
To help me from another lifetime,We took each others hands and cried
Like a river when we said hello
And we walked to Tir Na Nog,We made a big connection
On a golden autumn day
We were standing in the garden wet with rain
And our souls were young again in Tir Na Nog,And outside the storm was raging
Outside Jerusalem
We drove in our chariots of fire
Following the big sun in the west
Going up going up to Tir Na Nog,You came into my life
And you filled me and you filled me
Oh, so joyous by the clear cool crystal streams
Where the roads were quiet and still
And we walked all the way to Tir Na Nog,How can we not be attached
After all we're only human
The only way then is to never come back
Except I that wouldn't want that would you
If we weren't together again in Tir Na Nog,We've been together before in a different incarnation
And we loved each other then as well
And we sat down in contemplation
Many many many times you kissed mine eyes
In Tir Na Nog"

Oh, the smell of the bakery from across the street
got in my nose
as we carried our ladders down the street
with the wrought-iron gate rows
i went home and listened to jimmie rodgers in my lunch-break
bought five woodbines at the shop on the corner
and went straight back to work.
Oh, sam was up on top
and i was on the bottom with the v
we went for lemonade and paris buns
at the shop and broke for tea
i collected from the lady
and i cleaned the fanlight inside-out
i was blowing saxophone on the weekend
in that down joint.
What's my line?
i'm happy cleaning windows
take my time
i'll see you when my love grows
baby don't let it slide
i'm a working man in my prime
cleaning windows (number a hundred and thirty-six)
I heard leadbelly and blind lemon
on the street where i was born
sonny terry, brownie mcghee,
muddy waters singin' ""i'm a rolling stone""
i went home and read my christmas humphreys' book on zen
curiosity killed the cat
kerouac's ""dharma bums"" and ""on the road""
What's my line?
i'm happy cleaning windows
take my time
i'll see you when my love grows

With a childlike vision leaping into view
Clicking, clacking of the high heeled shoe
Ford and Fitzroy, Madame George
Marching with the soldier boy behind
He's much older with hat on drinking wine
And that smell of sweet perfume comes drifting through
The cool night air like Shalimar
And outside they're making all the stops
The kids out in the street collecting bottle-tops
Gone for cigarettes and matches in the shops
Happy taken Madame George
That's when you fall
Whoa, that's when you fall
Yeah, that's when you fall
When you fall into a trance
A sitting on a sofa playing games of chance
With your folded arms and history books you glance
Into the eyes of Madame George
And you think you found the bag
You're getting weaker and your knees begin to sag
In the corner playing dominoes in drag
The one and only Madame George
And then from outside the frosty window raps
She jumps up and says Lord have mercy I think it's the cops
And immediately drops everything she gots
Down into the street below
And you know you gotta go
On that train from Dublin up to Sandy Row
Throwing pennies at the bridges down below
And the rain, hail, sleet, and snow
Say goodbye to Madame George
Dry your eye for Madame George
Wonder why for Madame George
And as you leave, the room is filled with music, laughing, music,
dancing, music all around the room
And all the little boys come around, walking away from it all
So cold
And as you're about to leave
She jumps up and says Hey love, you forgot your gloves
And the gloves to love to love the gloves...
To say goodbye to Madame George
Dry your eye for Madame George
Wonder why for Madame George
Dry your eyes for Madame George
Say goodbye in the wind and the rain on the back street
In the backstreet, in the back street
Say goodbye to Madame George
In the backstreet, in the back street, in the back street
Down home, down home in the back street
Gotta go
Say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Dry your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye...
Say goodbye to Madame George
And the loves to love to love the love
Say goodbye
Oooooo
Mmmmmmm
Say goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye to Madame George
Dry your eye for Madame George
Wonder why for Madame George
The love's to love the love's to love the love's to love...
Say goodbye, goodbye

I may go crazy
Before that mansion on the hill,I may go crazy
Before that mansion on the hill
But my heart keeps beating faster
And my feet can't keep still,And all the little girls rhyme something
On the way back home from school
And all the little girls rhyme something
On the way back home from school,And the leaves fall one by one
And call the autumn time a fool,Yeah, my t-tongue gets tied
Every, every, every time I try to speak
My tongue gets tied
Every time I try to speak,And my inside shakes just like a leaf on a tree
I think I'll go on by the river with my cherry, cherry wine
I believe I'll go walking by the railroad with my cherry, cherry wine
If I pass the rumbling station where the lonesome engine drivers pine,Wait a minute, yonder come my lady
Rainbow ribbons in her hair
Yonder come my lady
Rainbow ribbons in her hair,Six white horses and a carriage
She's returning from the fair
Baby, baby, baby,And I'm caught one more time
Up on Cyprus Avenue
And if I'm, yeah, caught one more time
Up on Cyprus Avenue,And I'm conquered in a car seat
And I'm looking straight at you,Way up on, way up on, way up on
The avenue of trees,Keep walking down
In the wind and the rain, darling
You keep walking down when the sun shone through the trees,Nobody, no, no, no, no, nobody stops me from loving you baby
So young and bold, fourteen-year old

Now what we only dreamed is what we live
All through the dark roads that we've tread
When a dream was all we had
The thought of our home is still a whisper, barely heard
We raised our flag upon the shore
And sang out we are Singapore
We learnt that home is really more than just a word
Today, tomorrow this will always be my HOME"

We sat and let sonny boy, blow, blow his harp,Take me back, take me back, take me back

Child, you were heading for a fall
But if it gets to you

And this time I forget to slip into your slumber
The light is on the left side of your head
And I'm standing in your doorway
And I'm mumbling and I can't remember the last thing that ran through my head,Here come the man and he say, he say the show must go on
So all you gotta do

Across the street from Cathedral Notre Dame.,Meanwhile back in San Francisco
We're trying hard to make this whole thing blend,
As we sit upon this jagged
Storey block, with you my friend.,And it's a long way to Buffalo.
It's a long way to Belfast city too.
And I'm hoping the choice won't blow the hoist
'Cos this town, they bit off more than they can chew.,As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on

Against the Safeway's supermarket in the rain.
And everybody feels so determined
Not to feel anyone else's pain.,(You know that) No one's making no commitments
To anybody but themselves,
Hidin' behind closed doorways,
Tryin' to get outside, outside of empty shells,And for every cross-cuttin' country corner,
For every Hank Williams railroad train that cried,
And all the chains, badges, flags and emblems
And every strain on every brain and every eye (?),As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on
As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on

Right about now your face should wear a smile.,That's the way it all should happen
When you're in, when you're in the state you're in;
You've got your pen and notebook ready,
I think it's about time, time for us to begin.,And we're over in a 52nd Street apartment,
Socializing with the wino few,
Just to be hip and get wet with the jet set.
But they're flying too high to see my point of view.,As we gaze out on, as we gaze out on

When the wind blows up the collar and the ears are frostbitten too

Left me to come through
I headed for the right way
I knew exactly just what to do
I dreamed we played cards in the dark
And you lost and you lied
Wasn't very hard to do
But hurt me deep down inside,Chorus:
Mmmm, these dreams of you
So real and so true
These dreams of you
So real and so true,My back was up against the wall
And you slowly just walked away
You never really heard my call
When I cried out that way
With my face against the sun
You pointed out for me to go
Then you said I was the one
Had to reap what you did sow,Chorus,Bridge:
And hush-a-bye, don't ever think about it
Go to sleep don't ever say one word
Close your eyes, you are an angel sent down from above,And Ray Charles was shot down
But he got up to do his best
A crowd of people gathered round
To the question answered ""yes""
And you slapped me on the face
I turned around the other cheek
You couldn't really stand the pace
And I would never be so meek,Chorus bridge"

I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I may one day rue,I saw the danger, yet I walked
Along the enchanted way
And I said,? Let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day?,I said, on Grafton Street in November
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worst of passions pledged,The 'Queen of Hearts' still baking tarts
And I, and I, and I, and I not making hay
Well, I loved too much by such and such
Is happiness thrown away, alright,I gave her the gifts of the mind
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to all the artists who have
Known true Gods of sound and time,With word and tint I never did not stint
I gave her reams of, reams of poems to say
With her own name there and her shiny black hair
Like the clouds over fields of May,On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
I see, I see her walking now
Away from me, away from me so hurriedly
My reason, my reason, my reason, my reason must allow,For I have wooed, not as I should
A creature made of clay
When the angel woos the clay, he'll lose
His wings at the dawn of the day, alright"

Drove through Shrigley taking pictures
And on to Killyleagh
Stopped off for Sunday papers at the
Lecale District, just before Coney Island,On and on, over the hill to Ardglass
In the jamjar, autumn sunshine, magnificent
And all shining through,Stop off at Ardglass for a couple of jars of
Mussels and some potted herrings in case
We get famished before dinner,On and on, over the hill and the craic is good

Streaming through the window in the autumn sunshine

A train a-coming down the long lonesome track.

You know that someday I'm, I'm coming back

I'd love to stay and talk but it's almost 8 o'clock,
And I haven't got the time!,Because we work real hard at the chocolate factory
We start at 8 and we don't get lunch till three.
I gotta drive a truck
To make a buck
So I can send it home to my family,Well now you are in trouble
Your time card is a wreck
It's almost two past 8 I'll tell Nezzer that you're late
And he'll take it from your check,Yes, Mr. Lunt,Oh yes we work real hard at the chocolate factory
Excuse me Mr. Lunt but I've got an injury
Now get back on the line
You'll be just fine
With all this work to do we've got no time for sympathy,We used to be so happy
We used to laugh and run
Now there's no time to play 'cuz we gotta work all day
And it isn't very fun,I'm Rack!
I'm Shack!
I'm Benny!
We work here in the plant
We'd like to take a break
For goodness' sake
But Mr. Nezzer says
You can't! haha,We all need a vacation
Our schedule is severe
We're getting very tired but stopping gets us fired
So we'll have to stay right here,Because we work real hard at the chocolate factory
We start at 8 and we don't get lunch till 3
We work the whole week through
To make a buck or two
So we can send them home to our families,Someday they'll come and join us
We'll live in harmony
We hope the day is near until then you'll find us here

When a baby was born in the night
And those who came far who followed the star
Were seeing a heavenly sight
A heavenly sight,Well, the years hurried by and the boy, now a man
Could make the blind see with a touch of His hand
He was born to be King, He was Rabbi and Priest
But the best that He had, He gave to the least
He gave to the least,He was born and He died, almost 2, 000 years ago
He laughed and He cried, He felt all the fears we know
But what does it matter? A story so strange
Even if it is true, what does it change?
What does it change?,Though He spoke like a prophet, like no one they'd heard
This simple young carpenter, crowds hung on every word
He hated injustice, He taught what is right
He said,? I'm the way and the truth and the light?,His friends soon believed that truly He was the one
The Savior, Messiah, God's one and only Son
But others they doubted, they did not agree
So they took Him, they tried Him
He died on a tree, He died on a tree,God has made a way
For all who mourn and grieve
Death will never be the end
If you just believe,God has made a way
For all who mourn and grieve
Death will never be the end
If you just believe,There is nothing left to fear
Nothing Heaven knows
For He died for us to give us life
And to give us hope He rose,Hey Annie, your steps lookin' peppy again
I guess, when I think of Easter
Is really about
That was a great egg hunt after all,I hope those hurt more kids
Our class is almost over
Hey junior, I think someone
Is here to see you,Dad, what are you doin' here?
I caught an earlier flight junior
I couldn't bare to spend Easter Sunday away from my favorite son
Oh dad, I'm your only son"

Got outta Dodge,
Sailed on a bon-less
Bon voyage.
You said North,
I headed South.
Tossed overboard.
Good Lord, that's a really large mouth...,I'm sleeping with fishes here,
In the belly of the whale.
I'm highly nutritious here,
In the belly of the whale.
Bad food, lousy atmosphere.
I don't wanna bellyache.
How long is this gonna take?,Woke up this morning kinda blue,
Thinking through that age-old question:
How to exit a whale's digestion?
It might behoove me to be heaved.
Head out like a human comet.

Enzymes, they come breaking us down to the core.
The good Lord grants we all get a second chance.,I'm one of the dishes here,
In the belly of the whale.,
They say I'm delicious here,
In the belly of the whale.
Lord, please make him chuck it all.

It's a-gettin' to me,
But it's roomier
Than the tail.
Hey, sailor,
Got my flow free
Like a salmon to the sea
From the L.A. Symphony.
I'm a paddleboat
Paddlin' in their wake,
A fake free-styler,
But my unemployment pays.
I'm avoiding cliches
Like ""whale of a tale"" say
Or ""you can't keep
A good man down,""
'Cause you can
And I've been there, man.
But I've been expectorated.
I'm elated!
I'm free like Willie!
Happy Day!
Oops,
That's a bit of a cliche.,In the belly..."

One day Jesus was teaching
In a house in old Caperdo,When out of the blue
Through a hole in the roof
A man was lowered down
And though he couldn't walk
When Jesus said get up
He jumped and ran around,It's a miracle, another miracle
Something only God can do
It's a sign, it's a wonder
How remarkable, incredible
Phenomenal, sensational miracle,Blind Bart sittin' by the road
In crowded Jericho
Begging for food, such a sad good old dude
It was a tale of woe
Till Jesus came by and heard his cry
Have mercy on me, Lord
And the next thing he knew
He was enjoying the view
His sight had been restored
(I can see),It's a miracle, another miracle
Something only God can do
It's a sign, it's a wonder
How remarkable, incredible
Phenomenal, sensational miracle,Five thousand hungry people
Are crowded on a hill
But all they could munch was a little boy's lunch
How would they get their fill?
But Jesus took those loafs and fishes
He knew He had enough
He filled up baskets, plates and dishes
And broke and passed and broke and passed
And broke and passed until that last, everyone was stuffed,God does miracles every single day
Just look around and you will say,It's a miracle, another miracle
Something only God can do
It's a sign, it's a wonderful miracle
It's a miracle, another miracle
Something only God can do

You forgive, I'll forgive you
I'm gonna start to show forgiveness from my heart!
So do your part, and show forgiveness from your heart!"

It's an edict stating most concisely what we're all to do
We must bow our heads or bend our knees before no one but you,I see, just one more time, now, let's see if I've got this straight
A law to prove once and for all that I am great
If I'm the king, no one must doubt my full supremacy
So, from this day forth my citizens will pray to only me,Yes, but what if they don't? If they don't obey, any citizen
Will be thrown into the lion's den, oh yes, well, I guess that would do it
Alright then, good work, men, tah tah, so the law was passed
The deed was done, Daniel's troubles had just begun,Everyone in Babylon heard about the new law

I'm sick of settling for in between
And I'm not givin' up

Let's watch the sun come up
We'll sleep when we're dead 'cause
Halfway kinda sucks
We're heading for the sky
And will get lost in it 'cause
All I want, all I want, all I want is everything
And I will pose if I wanna
And I will vogue like Madonna
I might not dance like MJ R.I.P
But I will give the best of me
All I want is everything,

I'm sick of settling for in between
And I'm not givin' up,As long as it feels right

Yes everything, yeah
Hold on to me
And I'll hold on to you
Don't over think
What have we got to lose?
It's me and you,
Me and you no matter what
We're heading for the sky
And we'll get lost in it 'cause
All I want, all I want, all I want is everything
And I will pose if I wanna

I feel brand new
You opened up my heart
Show me all your love, and walk right through
Mark: Cause I lay my love, I lay my love on you,All: I lay my love on you
You make me feel brand new
Show me all your love and walk right through
As I lay my love on you
Shane: As I lay my love on you"

when all the birds are singing in the sky
now that spring is in the air

you tried to teach me right from wrong
too much wine and too much song

me find the sun

you would always come around

About her in my heart,(CHORUS)

Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
That she's my only one
If my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes,Cause I've lost love ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance
To tell her how I feel,(Repeat Chorus),So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of

And when she wakes up and makes up her mind

She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys

Uptown girl, you know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been and then I'll win,And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine

Some in their solitary lives

To watch the sunrise on your face
To know that I can say I love you

Those are the things that make you mine

And you'll be where it ends

Or where you may be
(Where you may be)
I just close my eyes
(Just close my eyes)
And you're in my dreams
And there you will be until we meet
I'll always look back as I walk away
This memory will last for eternity
And all off our tears will be lost in the rain
When I find my way back to your arms again
But until that day you know you are
The queen of my heart
I'll always look back as I walk away
This memory will last for eternity
And all off our tears will be lost in the rain
When I find my way back to your arms again
But until that day you know you are
The queen of my heart
Oh yeah
You're the queen of my heart
(Queen of my heart)
No matter how many years it takes
(Queen of my heart)
I'll do it all to you, oh yeah
(Queen of my heart)
Oh yes you are
The queen of my heart"

That drowns the tender reed.
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed.,Some say love it is a hunger
An endless, aching need
I say love it is a flower,
And you its only seed.,It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance,It's the one who won't be taken,
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live.,When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long.
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong.,Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love,
In the spring, becomes the rose."

You. when I'm with you,What good's a memory
Without you there with me
The morning sun ain't the same
Without you here
You are the summer breeze
The wind blowing through the trees
You make the loneliness
All just disappear,Nothing replaces your touch
Never stop believing in us
They try to break us
But we stand strong in love
They'll be no distance too far
I gotta be where you are (right where you are),I don't wanna face this world alone
Without you by my side
You're the only one
That makes it feel like home
And I need you in my life
When you're not around I'm feeling
Like a piece of me is missing
When it feels like the day is closing in
Somehow I find the faith
To make it through
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you you you
You. when I'm with you,What's a photograph
If you're not in the other half
Why even dream
If I'm not dreaming of you
You make me a better man
Promise I'll do all I can
Your love keeps me bringing me
Closer to the truth,Nothing replaces your touch
Never stop believing in us
They try to break us

Would ever show me a sign
The moment I saw you
That's when I knew

Without you by my side
You're the only one

When all the birds are singing
In the sky
Now that spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I ll be there,We had joy we had fun we had
Seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed were
Just seasons out of time,Goodbye papa please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along,Goodbye papa it s hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air

When you see them I ll be there,We had joy we had fun we had

Me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on
The ground,Goodbye michelle it s hard to die
When all the birds are singing in

With the flowers everywhere

What am I doing without you?
...,What am I doing without you?

Well, I guess I'm ready
For settling down
And fooling around is over
And I swear that it's true
No buts or maybes
When I'm falling down,There's always someone who saves me
And girl it's you,Oh, funny how life can be so surprising
I'm just realizing what you do
Oh, we got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
And all of the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside of my door,And all of the time I'm looking for something new
What am I doing without you?
Well, it's feeling right now
So let's do it right now
Praying that some how
You will understand the way,It's feeling right now
Baby, somehow I won't let this slip away
Oh, we got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows,I let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
We got a little world of our own
I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
All of the things I've been looking for,Have always been here outside of my door

There's no beat, without you
You're not gone, but you're not here
Instead that's the way it seems tonight
If we could try to end these wars
I know that we can make it right
Cause baby,I don't wanna fight no more
I forgot what we were fighting for
& this loneliness that's in my heart
Wont let me be apart from you
I don't want to have to try
Girl to live without you in my life
So I'm hoping we can start tonight
Cause I don't wanna fight
No more,How can I live
When everything that I adore
And everything I'm living for
Girl it's in you
I can't dream
Sleepless nights have got me bad
The only dream I ever had
Is being with you
I know that we can make it right
It's gonna take a little time
Lets not leave ourselves with no way out
Lets not cross that line,I don't wanna fight no more
I forgot what we were fighting for

I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me oh Mandy,Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy,I'm standing on the edge of time
I walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my mind
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy,Well you came and you gave without taking

When you're looking like that,Am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that

Now I can't take it back

Deserves to be as happy as you make me

Will know the way I'm feeling, looking

That's why I can't bear to be too far away
I know that god must love me cause
He sent you to me on angel's wings

And you don't ever notice how I stare when we're alone
Or wonder why I keep you on the phone
I've made it obvious
Done everything but sing it,(I've crushed on you so long but on and on you get me wrong)
I'm not so good with words,And since you never notice
The way that we belong
I'll say it in a love song
Yeah...
You are my very first thought in the morning
And my last at nightfall
You are the love that came without warning
I need you, I want you to know
I've made it obvious,So finally I'll sing it
(I've crushed on you so long),I'm not so good with words
And since you never notice
The way that we belong
I'll say it in a love song
And sing it until the day you're holding me
I've wanted you so long but on and on you get me wrong
I more then adore you but since you never seem to see
But you never seem to see
I'll say it in this love song"

And soon I'll match them in renown!
And nobody in all of Oz

So now it's up to you
For both of us
Now it's up to you,(Glinda)
I've heard it said
That people come into our lives for a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led
To those who help us most to grow
If we let them
And we help them in return
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today
Because I knew you...
Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
Because I knew you
I have been changed for good,(Elphaba)
It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me
Like a handprint on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have re-written mine
By being my friend...
Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a skybird
In a distant wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you,(Glinda)
Because I knew you,(Both):
I have been changed for good,(Elphaba)
And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness
For the things I've done, you blame me for,(Glinda)
But then, I guess we know
There's blame to share,(Both)
And none of it seems to matter anymore,(Glinda)
Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood,(Elphaba)
Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a bird
In the wood (Harmony over Glinda),(Both)
Who can say if I've been
Changed for the better?
I do believe I have been
Changed for the better,(Glinda)
And because I knew you...,(Elphaba)
Because I knew you...,(Both)

To think of
Celebrated heads of state or
Specially great communicators
Did they have brains or knowledge?
Don't make me laugh!,They were popular! Please -
It's all about popular!
It's not about aptitude
It's the way you're viewed
So it's very shrewd to be
Very very popular
Like me!,(spoken) Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you. You're beautiful.,ELPHABA: (spoken) i...i have to go,GALINDA

You're gonna grin and bear it

Just not quite as popular

(sung) Many years I have waited
For a gift like yours to appear
Why, I predict the Wizard
Could make you his
Magic grand vizier!
My dear, my dear
I'll write at once to the Wizard
Tell him of you in advance
With a talent like yours, dear
There is a defin-ish chance
If you work as you should
You'll be making good:,ELPHABA

Have I actually understood?

Once I prove my worth
And then I meet the Wizard
What I've waited for since: since birth!
And with all his Wizard wisdom
By my looks, he won't be blinded
Do you think the Wizard is dumb?
Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded?
No! He'll say to me,
""I see who you truly are -
A girl on whom I can rely!""
And that's how we'll begin
The Wizard and I:,Once I'm with the Wizard
My whole life will change
'Cause once you're with the Wizard
No one thinks you're strange!
No father is not proud of you,
No sister acts ashamed
And all of Oz has to love you
When by the Wizard you're acclaimed
And this gift - or this curse -
I have inside
Maybe at last, I'll know why
When we are hand and hand -
The Wizard and I!,And one day, he'll say to me, ""Elphaba,
A girl who is so superior
Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside
Have a matching exterior?
And since folks here to an absurd degree
Seem fixated on your verdigris
Would it be all right by you
If I de-greenify you?"",And though of course
That's not important to me
""All right, why not?"" I'll reply
Oh, what a pair we'll be
The Wizard and I:
Yes, what a pair we'll be
The Wizard and:,Unlimited
My future is unlimited
And I've just had a vision
Almost like a prophecy
I know - it sounds truly crazy
And true, the vision's hazy
But I swear, someday there'll be
A celebration throughout Oz
That's all to do with me!,And I'll stand there with the Wizard
Feeling things I've never felt
And though I'd never show it
I'll be so happy, I could melt!
And so it will be
For the rest of my life
And I'll want nothing else
Till I die
Held in such high esteem
When people see me, they will scream
For half of Oz's fav'rite team:

The trouble with schools is
They always try to teach the wrong lesson
Believe me, I've been kicked out
Of enough of them to know
They want you to become less callow
Less shallow,But I say: Why invite stress in?
Stop studying strife
And learn to live ""the unexamined life""
Dancing through life
Skimming the surface
Gliding where turf is smooth
Life's more painless
For the brainless
Why think too hard
When it's so soothing?
Dancing through life
No need to tough it
When you can slough it off as I do
Nothing matters
But knowing nothing matters
It's just life
So keep dancing through...
Dancing through life
Swaying and sweeping
And always keeping cool
Life is fraught less
When you're thoughtless
Those who don't try
Never look foolish
Dancing through life
Mindless and careless
Make sure you're where less
Trouble in life
Woes are fleeting
Blows are glancing
When you're dancing
Through life...
So--what's the most swankified place in town?,Galinda:
That would be the Ozdust Ballroom.,Fiyero:
Sounds perfect!
Lets go down to the Ozdust Ballroom
We'll meet there later tonight
We can dance till it lights
Find the prettiest girl
Give her a whirl
Right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom
Come on, follow me
You'll be happy to be there,All:
Dancing through life
Down at the Ozdust...,Fiyero:
If only because dust is what we come to...
All:
Nothing matters
But knowing nothing matters
It's just life...
Fiyero:
So keep dancing through...,Boq:
Miss Galinda- I hope you'll save at least one
dance for me. I'll be right there, waiting, all night.,Galinda:
Oh - that's so kind. But you know what would
Be even kinder?
See that tragically beautiful girl
The one in the chair?
It seems so unfair
We should go on a spree
And not she,Gee-
I know someone would be my hero
If that someone were
To go invite her...,Boq:
Well, maybe I could invite her!,Galinda:
Oh, Bick, really?
You would do that for me?,Boq:
I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda,Galinda:
So...
Fiyero:
So I'll be picking you up around eight?,Galinda:
After all-
Now that we've met one another,Fiyero and Galinda:
It's clear we deserve each other,Galinda:
You're perfect,Fiyero:
You're perfect,Both:
So we're perfect together
Born to be forever
Dancing through life,Nessarose:
Oh, Elphaba - Isn't it wonderful?
Finally, for this one night
I'm about to have a fun night
With this Munchkin boy
Galinda found for me
And I only wish there were
Something I could do for her
To repay her
Elphaba, see?
We deserve each other
And Galinda helped it come true
We deserve each other
Me and Boq
Please, Elphaba, try to understand,Elphaba:
I do...,Elphaba:
Galinda listen - Nessa and I were talking about you
just now--,Galinda:
And I was just talking about you! I thought you
Might want to wear this hat to the party tonight!
It's really, uh, sharp, don't you think?
You know black - is this year's pink
You deserve each other
This hat and you
You're both so.. Smart!
You deserve each other
So here, out of the goodness of my
Heart...,Boq:
Listen - Nessa -,Nessarose:
Yes?,Boq:
Uh - Nessa
I've got something to confess, a
Reason why, well -
Why I asked you here tonight
Now I know it isn't fair...,Nessarose:
Oh, Boq, I know why.,Boq:
You do?,Nessarose:
It's because I'm in this chair
And you felt sorry for me
Well - isn't that right?,Boq:
No! No! It's because, ah, because...
Because you are so beautiful!,Nessarose:
Oh, Boq, I think you're wonderful!
And we deserve each other
Don't you see, this is our chance?
We deserve each other
Don't we, Boq?,Boq:
You know what? Let's dance.,Nessarose:
What?,Boq:
Let's dance!,All:
Dancing through life
Down at the Ozdust
If only because dust
Is what we come to
And the strange thing:
Your life could end up changing
While you're dancing
Through!"

Was I really seeking good
Or just seeking attention?
Is that all good deeds are
When looked at with an ice-cold eye?
If that's all good deeds are
Maybe that's the reason why!...
No good deed goes unpunished
All helpful urges should be circumvented
No good deed goes unpunished
Sure, I meant well -
Well, look at what well-meant did:
All right, enough - so be it
So be it, then...
Let all Oz be agreed
I'm wicked through and through
Since I can not succeed
Fiyero, saving you
I promise no good deed
Will I attempt to do again,
Ever again
No good deed
Will I do again!!!"

That's the way with Wicked -

Couldn't be happier

Secretary, I have striven to ensure that all of Oz
knows the story of your braverism:,(sung) The day you were first summoned
To an audience with Oz And although he would not tell you why initially
When you bowed before his throne
He decreed you'd hence be known
As Glinda the Good - officially!,Then with a jealous squeal
The Wicked Witch burst from concealment
Where she had been lurking -surreptitiously!,PEOPLE IN CROWD
I hear she has an extra eye
That always remains awake
I hear that she can shed her skin
As easily as a snake!
I hear some rebel Animals
Are giving her food and shelter!
I hear her soul is so unclean
Pure water can melt her!,FIYERO
What!?,CROWD
Melt her!?
Please - somebody go and melt her!,FIYERO

fetch me a refreshment. He's so thoughtful that way!,(sung) That's why I couldn't be happier
No, I couldn't be happier
Though it is, I admit
The tiniest bit
Unlike I anticipated
But I couldn't be happier
Simply couldn't be happier
(spoken) Well - not ""simply"":
(sung) 'Cause getting your dreams
It's strange, but it seems
A little - well - complicated
There's a kind of a sort of a cost
There's a couple of things get: lost
There are bridges you cross
You didn't know you crossed
Until you've crossed
And if that joy, that thrill
Doesn't thrill you like you think it will
Still -
With this perfect finale
The cheers and ballyhoo
Who wouldn't be happier?
So I couldn't be happier
Because happy is what happens
When all your dreams come true
Well, isn't it?
Happy is what happens
When your dreams come true!,CROWD

Then,Suddenly I'm here, respected, worshiped, even

and all too soon.

I got carried away, and not just by balloon.,Wonderful, they called me wonderful,
So I said, ""Wonderful, if you insist.
I Will Be Wonderful"" and they said, ""Wonderful!""

And he's not really sure about life, or that how could any of this be right

Step into the light,Keep straight ahead for the most glorious place
On the face of the earth or the sky
Hold onto your breath
Hold onto your heart
Hold onto your hope

Kansas, she says, is the name of the star.
She brings you good news. Or haven't you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas
A miracle occurred.
It really was no miracle. What happened was just this.
The wind began to switch - the house to pitch and suddenly
the hinges started to unhitch.
Just then the Witch - to satisfy an itch went flying
on her broomstick, thumbing for a hitch.
And oh, what happened then was rich.
*The house began to pitch. The kitchen took a slitch.
It landed on the Wicked Witch
in the middle of a ditch,
Which was not a healthy situation for the Wicked Witch.
(* = repeated)
... Who began to twitch and was reduced to just a stitch
of what was once the Wicked Witch."

That was the Wicked Witch of the East. This is her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's much worse than the other one.

Who killed my sister? Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you?
Dorothy
No, no. It was an accident. I didn't mean to kill anybody.

Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents too!

Oh, fiddle faddle! You have no power here. Be gone before somebody drops a house on you, too!

Very well, I'll bide my time - but just try to stay out of my way - just try! I'll get you,

sleep, my dear.

No, that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful

Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity.
Back where I come from we have universities - seats of great learning -
where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out,
they think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have. But -
they have one thing you haven't got - a diploma! Therefore, by virtue
of the authority vested in me by the Universita Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum,
I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
Scarecrow
Th.D.?
Wizard
Yeah - that - that's Dr. of Thinkology
Scarecrow
How can I ever thank you enough?
Wizard
Well, you can't! As for you my fine friend, you are a victim or disorganized thinking.
You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger you
have no courage! You are confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come fro mwe have
men who are called heroes. Once a year they take their fortitude out of mothballs and
parade it down the main street of the city. And they have no more courage than you have.
But - they have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!! Therefore, for meritorious conduct,
extraordinary valor, conspicuous bravery against wicked witches, I award you the Triple Cross.
You are now a member of the Legion of Courage!
Lion
Oh - oh, shucks, folks - I'm speechless!
Wizard
As for you, my galvanized friend - you want a heart!
You don't know how lucky you are not to have one.
Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.
Tin Man
But I - I still want one.
Wizard
Back where I come from there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds.
They are called phil....er.....phil...er...er....good-deed-doers
and their hearts are no bigger than yours, but they have one thing you haven't got!
A testimonial! Therefore, in consideration of your kindness, I take pleasure
at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection.
And remember, my sentimental friend, that a heart is not judged by how much you love,
but by how much you are loved by others.
Tin Man
Oh, Oh, it ticks! Listen! Look, it ticks!
Lion
Read - read what my medal says. Courage! Ain't it the truth!
Dorothy
Oh - oh they're all wonderful.
Scarecrow
Hey, what about Dorothy?
Dorothy
Oh, I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.
Wizard
Well - you force me into a cataclysmic decision.
The only way to get Dorothy back to Kansas is for me to take her there myself!
Dorothy
Oh! Oh, will you? Could you? Oh! Oh, but are you a clever enough wizard to manage it?
Wizard
Child, you cut me to the quick! I'm an old Kansas man myself, born and bred -
in the heart of the western wilderness, premier Baloonist, highest class.
And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the Land of E Pluribus Unum!
This is positivey the finest exhibition ever to be shown.....well, be that as it may.
I, your Wizard, par adua outer, am about to embark on a hazardous and technically
unexplainable journey into the outer stratosphere. To confer, converse and otherwise
hob-nob with my brother wizards. And I hereby decree that until what time, if any,
that I return, the Scarecrow by virtue of his highly superior brains, shall rule in my stead,
assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart, and the Lion by virtue of his
courage! Obey them as you would me.

Dorothy
Oh - will you help me? Can you help me?
Glinda
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
Dorothy
I have?
Scarecrow
Then why didn't you tell her before?
Glinda
Because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself.
Tin Man
What have you learned, Dorothy?
Dorothy
Well, I - I think that it - that it wasn't enough just to want to see
Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. And that it's that - if I ever go looking
for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own backyard,
because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with. Is that right?
Glinda
That's all it is!
Glinda
Are you ready now?
Dorothy
Yes. Say goodbye, Toto. Yes, I'm ready now.

Mr Gale,
Uncle Henry
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
Miss Gulch
I want to see you and your wife right away, about Dorothy.
Uncle Henry
Dorothy? Well, what has Dorothy done?
Miss Gulch
What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Uncle Henry
You mean she bit you?
Miss Gulch
No, her dog!
Uncle Henry
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Miss Gulch
No!
Miss Gulch
That dog's a menace to the community.
I'm taking him to the Sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Dorothy
Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?
Uncle Henry
Of course, we won't. Will will Em?
Miss Gulch
Well, that's for the Sheriff to decide.
Miss Gulch
Here's what I'm taking him in - so he can't attack me again.
Dorothy
No, no, no! I won't let you take him! You go away! Ooooh, I'll bite you myself!
Aunt Em
Dorothy!
Dorothy
Oh, you wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!
Don't let her take him - please!
Miss Gulch
I've got an order! Let me have him!
Dorothy
Stop her!
Aunt Em
Put him in the basket, Henry.
Miss Gulch
The idea!
Dorothy
Don't, Uncle Henry. Oh, Toto!

Toto, Darling. Oh, I got you back, you came back! Oh, I'm so glad...
We've got to get away. We've got to run away.

It's a twister! It's a twister!!
Aunt Em
Dorothy! Dorothy!
Dorothy
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore! We must be over the rainbow!
Glinda
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Dorothy
Who, me! I - I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.
Glinda
Oh!
Dorothy
What was that?
Glinda
The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch. I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.
Dorothy
You are! I beg your pardon! But I've never heard of a beautiful witch before.
Oh. But - if you please, what are Munchkins?
Glinda
The little people who live in this land. It's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine,
my dear. It's all right - you may all come out and thank her."

Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath as hard as kerosene

She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boy, his horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know on the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dyin words, ah but that's the way it goes,All the Federales say, they could've had him any day
They only let him slip away, out of kindness I suppose,Lefty he can't sing the blues all night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low, Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go, there ain't nobody knows,All the Federales say, they could've had him any day
They only let him slip away out of kindness I suppose,The boys tell how old Pancho fell, and Lefty's livin in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends we're told
Pancho needs your prayers it's true, but save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do, and now he's growing old,All the Federales say, they could've had him any day
They only let him go so long, out of kindness I suppose,A few gray Federales say, they could've had him any day

And each night begins a new day.
If you don't understand him, an' he don't die young,
He'll prob'ly just ride away.,Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks.
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.
'Cos they'll never stay home and they're always alone.
Even with someone they love.,Cowboys like smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings,
Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night.
Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do,
Sometimes won't know how to take him.
He ain't wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him,
Do things to make you think he's right.,Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks.
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such.

There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend.
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes.
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.,And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine.
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear.
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women.
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.,Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other.
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother.
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out.,And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper.
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead.
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister.
You can't f**k with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head.,Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other.
What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother.
And inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out.
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out."

Of what I've lost and what I've won
I've survived every situation
Knowing when to freeze and when to run
And regret is just a memory written on my brow
And there's nothing I can do about it now.,I've got a wild and a restless spirit
I held my price through every deal
I've seen the fire of a woman's scorned
Turn her heart of gold to steal
I've got the song of the voice inside me
Set to the rhythm of the wheel
And I've been dreaming like a child
Since the cradle broke the bow
And there's nothing I can do about it now.,Running through the changes
Going through the stages
Coming round the corners in my life
Leaving doubt to fate
Staying out too late
Waiting for the moon to say goodniight
And I could cry for the time I've wasted
But that's a waste of time and tears,
And I know just what I'd change
If went back in time somehow

His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night,Don't cross him, don't boss him

Meant more to him than life

I sailed a schooner 'round the horn of mexico
I went aloft to furl the mainsail so little blow

across the river deep and wide
where steel and water did collide
a place called boulder on the wild colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
they buried me in that grey tomb that knows no sound

across the universe divide
and when i reach the other side

or i may simply be a single drop of rain

Cause it's all going to pot,That cackle-bobble-head-in-a-box
Must think I'm dumb as a rock
Readin' the daily news
While I'm kickin' off my shoes
It's scarin' me outta my socks,The Red Headed Stranger I'm not
But buddy, let me tell you what
Ask ol' Will, he'll tell ya here's the deal
Friends, it's all goin' to pot,Well, it's all going to pot
Whether we like it or not
Best I can tell
The world's gone to hell
And we're all gonna miss it a lot,All the whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Just doesn't hit the spot
I gotta hundred dollar bill
You can keep your pills, friend
Cause it's all goin' to pot,Well I thought I had found me a girl
Sweetest little thing in the world
But all my jokes went up in smoke
When I caught her makin eyes at Merle,He said, sweet little honey
With her eye on your money
She's gonna take every penny you got
I said she's never gonna get it
Cause I've already spent it
Merle, It's all goin' to pot,It's all going to pot
Whether we like it or not

The world's gone to hell
And we're all gonna miss it a lot,All the whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee

Standing where the highways cross.
And here we are saying goodbye.
Just another love lost in the great divide.,Here we are acting like two crazy kids.
We've come too far to ever see it end like this.
Just another love lost in the great divide.,Remember how we used to dance together.
Remember how I used to hold you tight.
You asked me if I'd leave and I said never.
And that's still right.,Summer sun, no prettier than summer rain.
Summer gone, summer coming back again.
Other loves lost in the great divide.,Remember how we used to dance together.

Impossible
For a plain country bumpkin and a prince to join in marriage
A slipper made of glass is just a shoe
And dreamers never make a dream come true
Impossible,Impossible
For a plain yellow pumpkin to become a golden carriage
Impossible
For a plain country bumpkin and a prince to join in marriage
And four white mice will never be four white horses

And won't believe what sensible people say

I think of a place where there's
Love overflowing;
I wish I was home,
I wish I was back there,
With the things I've been knowing.
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning,
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall
Have a meaning.
Sprinling the scene, makes it all clean.
Maybe there; s a chance
For me to go back
Now that I have some direction;
It sure would be nice to be back home,
Where there's love and affection.
And just maybe I can convince time
To slow up.
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up;
Time, be my friend, let me start again...
Suddenly my world is gone
And changed its face,
But I still know where I'm going;
I have had my mind spun around
In space
And yet I've watched it growing.
Oh, if you're listening God,
Please don't make it hard
to know if we should believe
The things we see.
Tell us, should we run away
Should we try and stay-
Or would it be better
Just to let things be?
Living here in this brand-new world
Might be a fantasy;
But it taught me to love,
So it's real, real, real to me...
And I've learned that we must look
Inside our hearts to find...
A world full of love
Like yours, like mine-
Like Home"

Nothing's better than family,
For the ones who love you so
Be a shoulder to cry on when you are in need
They will never leave you alone
when your friends bring you down
And they drag you through the dirt
And nobody is around
They will carry you through the hurt,Just remember that family comes first
where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)
Family comes first,
I can see you crying - someone broke your heart,
Instead of being with those who love you,
you spend time apart, It's because you think
they won't understand
The pain you're going through, So you don't reach out your
hand for them, 'til they'll pull and reach for you.,
Just remember that family comes first
where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)
Family comes first,
Don't you be ashamed of your family, put you into this earth,
and thats what its worth unconditionally, sometimes you may
disagree and wont see eye to eye
Don't you run away they will be right by your side
ooooh ohhh,Where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)

There can be miracles
When you believe,Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve,When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe,In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird,Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I cant explain
Seeking faith and speaking words,I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles

And its easy to give in, to your fears,But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain
A small but still, resilient voice
Says help is very near,There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah, though hope is frail)

Its hard to kill (Hard to kill, yeah),Who knows what miracles

This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real, soon enough
Let out your feelings tonight
Cause oh, I know that I want you

And the moment of truth,Far too many times a heart gets broken
Just because three words are never spoken
We can't let that bother us

How could I throw away a miracle
How could I face another day
It's all of my doing I made a choice
And today I pay
My heart is full of pain
How could you understand
The way I feel
How could you relate to so much pain
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today I pray
That someone should listen,For nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
How could I let go of a miracle
Nothing could ever take its place
Thought I was looking Out for myself
Now it seems the pain
Is all that I have gained
I wonder if I could be your miracle
I wonder if I could spare you pain
Seems as though nothing will comfort me
Lord, less today I pray
That you should come listen,For nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store
Don't ever throw away your miracle
Don't let it slip away
So nothing should matter,No nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
No nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store
huh, hmm... for you"

Hey baby,If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that,Now tell me how you feel
If I told you that I have feelings for you, baby?
And would it be so wrong to say what's on my mind?
I'm sorry I have to, baby baby,We were friends but with time
What I feel deep inside for you has changed
But I'd give up on love, if I thought
That it was untrue for you,If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that,I know that we are just friends
But what if I decide to bring something in? Oh yeah
I hope it won't offend the trust we have
'Cause I don't want this to end, no no no baby,If you think that we'll lose what we have
Then I'd just rather stay the same
'Cause I don't want to choose
Between two of the most precious things to me,If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that,If we take this chance
And extend to each other, romance
And I hope it would be
The right thing for you and me, oh yeah,If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you

And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that,Would you be there for me?
Could you dare to hold me?
Will my feelings leave me
Lonely, if I told you?,If I told you that, I wanted to see you
And if I told you that, I beg to please you
If I told you that, I'll always keep you
What would you say? If I told you that,Would you be there for me?

She can make her way in a man's world
And never be called just another girl,It ain't nothing like a dream
You can't see
Even when the people round you don't believe
But in the twelfth round
When you're against the ropes
Here comes your last minute miracle,
You've got to know to,Never never give up
Never never give up
No matter how many times
Somebody tell you
It ain't working,Never never give up
Never never give up
Hold your head to the sky
Look them right in the eyes
Tell you will never quit
Untill the day you get it right,Never never give up
Never never give up
Even though some days you will have to cry
Shake it off
And know that evenything will be alright
As long as you
Never never give up
Never never give up,The sky is the limit
for whatever you want to do
don't let anyone tell you it ain't possible
No matter how low you feel
Keep going higher
Higher,See I've been holding on
To my dreams too long
To watch it get away from me
This hand is mine to win
And I promise you that
I'll never never give up,Never never give up
Never never give up
No matter how many times
Somebody tell you
It ain't working,Never never give up
Never never give up
Hold your head to the sky
Look them right in the eyes
Tell you will never quit
Untill the day you get it right,Never never give up
Never never give up
Even though some days you will have to cry
Shake it off
And know that evenything will be alright
As long as you
Never never give up
Never never give up,Never never give up
Never never give up
No matter how many times
Somebody tell you
It ain't working,Never never give up
Never never give up
Hold your head to the sky
Look them right in the eyes
Tell you will never quit
Untill the day you get it right,Never never give up
Never never give up
Even though some days you will have to cry
Shake it off
And know that evenything will be alright
As long as you
Never never give up
Never never give up"

It might be pouring rain
Still the same, nothings changed
All and all I feel no shame

Just my heart that makes me feel this way
And I hope you feel the same way too,Midnight, I run to you

Fine, Fine, Fine, Fine, Fine,It's Alright,Had a dream last night
That the world stopped turning
But your madness, it kept on
Guess I wasn't too bright
And I really wasn't learning
Should have seen it all along,All those sweet, sweet kisses and those sweet red roses
They convinced me that it was you
I made you exclusive
Now it's so conclusive
That you wasn't doing it too,If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around it would have been fine
It would have been fine
Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around it would have been fine
Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time,Something didn't feel right
And I wish I knew it
I just could not see your games
I got respect for you
And you put me through it
Why would you bring me so much pain,I would stil love for you,'cause I did adore you
While my dogs would chew you out
Tried to be so nice on those lonely nights
But I should have figured you out,If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around it would have been fine
It would have been fine
Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time
I would have had a good time
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around it would have been fine

Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time,Baby you're so fine
You are the one that I saw
You are so fine
You're my...
Oh you're mighty fine
You're fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine
You are the one that I love
You're my...
You're fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine

Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time
Feel good time, feel good time, feel good time, feel good time
If you'd told me from the start that you're playing around it would have been fine
Had a real good time, boy now
Then I would have played too and I guess I would have had a good time

Time can pass so slowly
When you feel so all alone
Love can strikeour h like lightning
When you find yeart a home

Read about it in a book
I never thought I'd feel it
But your touch was all it took,Take good care of my heart
Take good care of my heart
Baby you're the first to take it
You're the only one who can break it
I love you more than I should
But it keeps me feeling so good
I've waited for your love forever
You're the one to take good care of my heart,Come and make your magic
Till you have me hypnotized
If we get any closer
I'll be drowning in your eyes
You're the one I needed most
When my love was on that line
Oh I'm so glad you gave me yours

So Im saving all my love for you,Its not very easy, living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
Cause Id rather be home feeling blue
So Im saving all my love for you,You used to tell me wed run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But thats just an old fantasy
Ive got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
For tonight is the night, for feeling alright
Well be making love the whole night through
So Im saving all my love
Yes Im saving all my love
Yes Im saving all my love for you,No other woman, is gonna love you more
Cause tonight is the night, that Im feeling alright
Well be making love the whole night through
So Im saving all my love
Yeah Im saving all my love
Yes Im saving all my love for you
For you, for you"

Akon and Whitney, yeah
(Oh yeah),Did you ever wish you could get back
Something that you did in your past?
If it wasn't for me I know what we had
Was definitely gonna last,I admit that we say some things
We don't mean when we're mad
But I realize that I've been foolish
I never should have turned my back,'Cause it's a cold world when you're out there all alone
So many times that I wanted to just pick up the phone
And tell you ooh baby, baby, I missed your loving so
I ain't holding back no more, your girl is coming home,And I want you to love me
(Like I never left)
And I want you to hold me
(Like I never left)
And I want you to touch me
(Like I never left)
Come give me what I'm missing, yeah
(Like I never left, yeah),Do you think we can pick up
Where we left before the day?
That I told you it was over, packed my things
And moved away,'Cause I see that without you
My world is just an empty place
Taking one step away from you feels like
A million miles away,'Cause it's a cold world when you're out there all alone
So many times I just wanted to pick up the phone

But I ain't holding back no more 'cause your man is coming home, yeah,And I want you to love me

You and me together, we back on top
Kind of love we got, it just don't stop
Like I never left,I had enough, I miss you bad

Flowing from my mind with ease
Soft as can be

Enchanted with your touch
It seems to me, we can sail together
In and out of mystery,I wanna be living

Can't feel as secure again

Love is not kisses, hugs, sharing fucking drugs
Pictures on your birthday, pictures of making love..Its dedication
Trusting patience and compromise..
Not do or die Ultimatums for you and i..
I feel the vibe between us fading I fucking hate it..
I cut myself constantly
Hate myself for creating..,Hate within your heart Im thinking this pistol tempting
Screaming out to my demons..
Get even within yourself
She crying she needs your help
And you selfish think bout yourself..
All these problems created, extended from hate for self, and i..."

Hey there you, looking for brighter season
Need to lay your burden down
Hey there you, drowning in a helpless feeling
Buried under deeper ground,[Verse 1]
I seem depressed, always being bothered never less
Keeping me out of prison and putting me to the test
They ask me what is happiness, you write it on a cheque
Or you feel it on the sweat, when your dick is in the breast,[Chorus: Laura Mvula (reversed)]
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own,[Verse 2]
If death is what it seems, why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Pitchers not receivers, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor, minds full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everybody is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when that heaven gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate your conversates
Hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, Acura
Accurate facts put the black in fact
If you thought that you are free, you should disregard that
All facts,[Chorus: Laura Mvula (reversed) & XXXTENTACION]
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Young X'ster, call me a young Dexter
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own
My hypothesis, is, death ain't shit
Hey there you
I'd rather die than be alive in this life
When the lights go out and you're on your own
Honestly full of strive and strive
Hey there you
When the lights go out and you're on your own,[Bridge: Laura Mvula]
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'
Hey there you
Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'

Try to stand up on your own two feet, and, stumblin'

(That's the wrong thing, that's the wrong thing)
(That's the wrong thing),I turned a blind eye
Let the borders get wavy
Nothing touches me lately
Shouldn't I be having fun?
(That's the wrong thing, that's the wrong thing)
(That's the wrong thing)
It's hard to define
When my memory's hazy
Everyone's trying to save me
Can't they see I'm having fun?
(That's the wrong thing, that's the wrong thing)
(That's the wrong thing to do),Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
(Can't tell no one what it means to me)
Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
(And the longer that I leave it, I can feel it taking over me),Shy away and hide out
When it's calling me out
When it's weighing me down
I'll play it down
When all the trouble I've found
Comes back around
If it's catching me now
(That's the wrong thing)
I'll play it down
(That's the wrong thing, that's the wrong thing)
(That's the wrong thing to do),Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
(Can't tell no one what it means to me)
Something's wrong, but I choose to be naive
(And the longer that I leave it, I can feel it taking over me),Either way, I play it down
(That's the wrong thing)
Either way, I play it down
(That's the wrong thing)
Either way, I play it down
(That's the wrong thing)
I play it down
(That's the wrong thing)
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down
Either way, I play it down

Don't you think its time, we lend a hand ,

and there's so many taking, when we should be giving.,So many wrongs , in this world today.
if we don't change - ---we're all gonna pay.
tell me what is the an-swer-- doesn't anybody know.?
intro 1234
there's all kinds people say thay wanna go to heaven,
while they keep holding on , to their devilesh ways.
and too many preaching,--- giving out all directions,
while their own path- seems to be- like a cloudy maze.,I've heard it's been written , some-where,in the good book.
We're gonna be reaping, from the seeds we sow.
maybe we can start planting,-- with love and forgiveness,
then we might wake up to see some of our goodness grow.
up
Now I'm not saying, that I've been an angel,
and I'm not claiming to be - of the ritchous kind.
but all I am asking ---is a light from this darkness
doesn't anybody see what's ahead,
or has the world gone blind,because there's too many dying---
before thay can start living,
and there's too many taking
and never wanna be giving.
there's so many wrongs in this world today,
if we don't change we're all gonna pay.
what's the answer for this world today ,
doesn't anybody know.
short turnaround to modulate up
some say-,we can't change this world ,
we're only in it for the ride,
maybe now it's not to late ,
don't you think it's time we tried
take a good look for yourself if you think i am ly--ing.
we can't keep on living this a-way , when there's too many dy-ing.,so if we want a better world today
maybe it's time we changed our way,
and we can help stop the dying,
if we only start trying.,because there's too many taking when they could be giving.
and there's too many dying when they should be liv-ing
so meny wrongs in this world today.
if we don't change, we're gonna pay. if we want to stop the dying
now's the time to start trying"

Farewell to the one who raked, the sand beneath my feet

Common ground we walked upon, with common feelings & common things
Yes it is a cruel world, but there is solace amongst the sin
Peace to you for now we'll share again, we'll share again,Farewell to the west now

To all the new faces, new minds & things to see
I am alone here, and my heart at times it weeps

I told her I didn't see nobody

Together they would find
Her long lost smile

With all of his heart
He wanted her mind
Her secrets and her trust,She would never do him any harm

It was dark in the sky
She turned and she said to him
With grey in her eyes,Go home again

Go back and repair your heart

Go back and repair your heart,His heart turned to liquid
And it trickled from his eyes

We walk them carelessly like we're walking on bricks and stone

Even when your flesh and bones and all that you be
My good amigo once say to me the truth will set you free
But I guess we have to wait sometimes, wait around and see,Chorus,I see a new sun rising again
Brand new colors, brand new man again
Sweeping up the pieces of the brokenness
Sweeping up the pieces, the pieces that we had,Chorus,No other pain, like losing a soul mate"

Here we stand Victorian
Where the white folk can grow to no so
Very little about the black folk
The same folk who rightfully own
This piece of beauty that we call our home,Well negativity is often heard from society
With conviction they preach
Not even knowing of whom they speak
I guess it's each to there own
Those that want to will know
I guess it's each to there own
Because from the top the views are old and grey,Well I feel so ashamed
Of this system and these ways
The tiny hearts that lead our nation
And tiny minds that let them in
And I see your confusion
I see your pain
I see your pain and your confusion
And there's still some with my skin
Who still try and hide the reason"

umgeben von Schildern, die uns sagen: Betreten Verboten!
Umgeben von Skinheads, die Türken und Afrikanern das Leben nehmen,
während Bullen daneben steh'n, um Problemen aus dem Weg zu geh'n.
Umgeben von Jasagern, die alles nur nachlabern,

Kontrolliert von korrupten Cops, die oft Sadisten sind,
Verdächtige suchen nach rassistischen Statistiken,
gefüttert von Firmen, die uns jahrzehntelang vergifteten,
informiert durch Medien, die's erst zu spät berichteten.
Scheiß auf'n Unfall im Pkw, Schäden von THC,
wir hab'n bald alle BSE.
Und du schaust noch auf dein EKG, bevor dein Herz stoppt
und denkst: 'Auf'n dickes Steak hätt' ich trotzdem jetzt Bock.'
Verdammt nochmal! Gehirnwäsche pur, rund um die Uhr,
und Vater Staat schlägt und vergewaltigt Mutter Natur.
Die scheiß Politiker dienen der dunklen Seite wie Darth Vader
und haben 'nen Horizont von circa einem Quadratmeter.
Keine eigene Meinung, doch zehn eigene Ratgeber.
Die schwachsinnigen Scheiß reden als hätten sie'n Sprachfehler,
hoffen, die braven Wähler zahlen weiterhin gerne Steuergelder,

Sag zu ihm: Gerhard, schau dir doch unsere Jugend mal an.
Ein Drittel starrt mit offenem Mund auf ihre Playstations,
das zweite Drittel feiert im Exzess als Rave-Nation
abhängig von teuflischen pharmazeutischen Erzeugnissen,
weil sie nicht wußten was diese scheiß Drogen bedeuteten.
Das dritte Drittel hängt perspektivlos rum auf deutschen Straßen,
Kids mit dreizehn Jahren zieh'n sich schon dies weiße Zeug in die Nase,
die keine Ziele, aber nur Träume haben und das sind meist teure Wagen,
sie planen ihr Leben nicht weiter als heute abend,
denken zur Not geht es wie bei Nintendo noch neu zu starten,
scheißen drauf, ob sie bald sterben - wer will schon alt werden?
In diesem Land, in dem mehr Schranken stehn als es Wege gibt,
mehr Mauern als Brücken, die Stimmung ist negativ.
Für die Alten: Darum rauchen wir täglich Weed
und deshalb sind ich und meine ganze Generation so depressiv.,

denn ihr habt Großes geleistet in diesen Tagen.
Und die Zweifler verstummten nach wenigen Stunden,
ihr habt euch hoch geboxt, denn ihr ward ganz unten.
Und wer so kämpft wie ihr, darf auch mal verliern,
die Menschen lieben euch, das wird euch motiviern.
Und mit 'n bisschen Abstand seht ihr, was ihr geleistet habt,
ihr hieltet das ganze Land emotional auf Trab.
Der 4. Juli dieses Jahres war kein schlechter Tag,
der 4. Juli war nur einfach nicht euer bester Tag.
Ihr habt Argentinien geschlagen, nach nem langen Spiel,
neues Spiel, neues Glück, denn dieses Leben bietet viel.
Ihr habt uns so viel geboten, eure Namen sollen klingen,
lasst uns ein Lied für euch schreiben und eure Namen singen.,Wir salutiern vor Kapitän Michael Ballack,
du hast trotz deiner Schmerzen krass geballert.
Hast hart gekämpft, den Elfer reingeschossen,
als ich deine Tränen sah, sind auch meine geflossen.,Der nächste deutsche Held heißt Torsten Frings,
spielt Mittelfeld und man weiß, er bringts.
Er war auserwählt, wurde ausgezählt,
Mann, wir waren geschockt, Torsten, du hast gefehlt.,Dann der famose Miro Klose, immer gut für ein schnelles Tor,
wirbelt auf die Windhose, sowas wie kommt zu selten vor.,Vorname Lukas, Spitzname Poldi, glaub mir, Lukas,
wir hatten voll die geile Zeit, dir zuzusehn,
kämpfe tapfer, gib uns die Chance
weiter auf deine Tore durchzudrehn.,Es ist schade, Jens Lehmann,
dass man dich zuhause nur selten sehn kann.
Hast uns nicht enttäuscht, aber zittern lassen.
Wir waren beunruhigt, du gelassen,
in deiner Ruhe liegt echt die Kraft.
Du hast dein Tor zu unseren Herzen aufgemacht.,Vor dem blauen Auge war schon den verletzte Arm,
doch das erste Tor Deutschlands schoss Philipp Lahm.
Dich spieln zu sehn, war 'ne Offenbarung.
Philipp, nie vergessen wir deinen Namen.,Hier kommt die Bastion Schweinsteiger,
selbst wenn er fällt, spielt er den Ball weiter.
Wer soll dich stoppen, jetz gehts erst los,
übernimm das Spiel und stell den Gegner bloß.,And we can't forget Per Mertesacker,
du machtest manchen Stürmer zum Kofferpacker,
hast den Job erledigt und dich so verewigt,
manch ein Gegner denkt bestimmt, he is mother...,Christoph Metzelder war Feuermelder
und Feuerlöscher der Spielfelder.
Der Gegner kommt, den Gegner stellt er,
Stürmer sind für ihn wie Bäume und Bäume fällt er.,Auch Sebastian Kehl wurde auswählt
und war in kürzester Zeit vom Kampf beseelt.
Er hat sein Bestes gegeben und machte sein Ding
und auch sein' Namen werden wir in Zukunft singen.,Wir ham uns so geschwünscht, dass Bernd Schneider,
dieses eine Tor macht, doch es wurde nichts, leider.
Aber Kopf hoch Bernd, wir ham dich mehr als gern,
als du spieltest, flogen Funken, du bist'n Pfundskerl.,Und Arne Friedrich war uns erst zu friedlich,
dann war er wie neugeborn und schließlich,
sah man die Tür vorm Tor sie schließt sich,
Arne Friedrich, Deutschland liebt dich.,Ey yo David Odonkor rennt blitzschnell zum Tor vor,
spiel deinen Pass und bereit noch so'n Tor vor.
Es hieß, wer ist dieser David, er ist unbekannt
jetzt wär' das ganze Land gern mit dem verwandt.,Du bist ne deutsche Bank, Tim Borowksi,
die Gegener wollen siegen, doch du schockst sie.
Wir wollen dich spieln seh und noch oft mit dir siegn
Wenn die Pumpe fast still steht, kommst du und dann pocht sie.,Und auch Robert Huth machte sich gut,
und tat was ein guter Mann auf dem Spielfeld tut.
Er brachte sich ein und man sah seinen Mut,
danach wieder auf die Bank, Robert ich zieh meinen Hut.,Mike Hanke auch dir gebührt Dank,
ein Stürmer hat kein leichtes Leben auf der Bank.
Ich hab auch ein Trikot und zwar die Nummer 9
und das nächste Mal wirst du uns mit deinen Toren erfreuen.,Die Zukunft gehört auch Marcell Jansen
ich seh' schon die Stürmer bei dir antanzen.
raub ihnen die Chancen und den Mut
Und tu' was ein Mann in unserer Abwehr tut.,Und waren Stürmer vor Jens Nowotny gestanden
Der Jens, der stoppt sie und weist sie in die Schranken.
Ich möchte mich bei dir für den Bereitschaftsdienst bedanken,
du hast für's Spiel gebrannt und ins Ziel geflankt.,Und auch Thomas Hitzlsberger, war oft befreit vom Spielfeldärger,
doch auch dir gebührt Dank an den Spielfeldrand.
Hätte das Mittelfeld gewankt, hätten wir dich getankt
und dann hättest du trotz Rückstand zum Tor geflankt.,Es grenzt fast schon an Wahn, dass wir Oliver Kahn
nicht im Tor, sondern am Spielfeldrand sahn.
Doch dank dir, Olli, du bist wirklich ein Meister
und hast unendlich viel für Land und Mannschaft getan.,Und auch Timo Hildebrandt saß nur am Spielfeldrand,
doch halt dich bereit, bald kommt deine Zeit,
wo dieses Land nach dem Elfmeterschiessen deinen Name schreit.,Oliver Neuville unser Trumpf fürs Spiel,
hat ein wichtiges Tor zur rechten Zeit erzielt.
Elfer versenkt, fast ein Geschenk
klar, dass man für ewig an dich denkt.,Ich danke dir herzlichst DJ Asamoah,
wegen dir kamen meine Songs in der Kabine vor.
DJ und Stürmer we want more.
Gerald Asamoah schieß' dein nächstes Tor!,Und Dank Jürgen Klinsmann's großer Vision,
träumten wir dann doch vom Sieg und hatten ihn schon.
Wir erheben dich auf's Neue, auf den Fußballthron
geh jetzt bitte nicht, wir verdoppeln deinen Lohn.
Ihr seid Träger der Würden Andy, Olli, Jogi, Jürgen,
wir würden euch und euren Helfer gern noch einiges aufbürden.
Also bleibt uns erhalten die EM steht vor der Tür,
schließlich habt ihr uns gerade fast zum Sieg geführt.
Vielen Dank dafür, es hat uns tief berührt,
Ich dank' dem Herrn für Euch alle,
Ehre wem Ehre gebührt.,Ehre wem Ehre gebührt"

Ein schweres graues Tuch,
Das die Sinne fast erstickt.
Die Gewohnheit zu Besuch.
Lange nichts mehr aufgetankt,
Die Batterien sind leer.
In ein Labyrinth verstrickt,
Ich seh' den Weg nicht mehr.
Ich will weg, ich will raus
Ich will - ich wünsch mir was
Und ein kleiner Junge nimmt mich an der Hand.
Er winkt mir zu und grinst:
Komm hier weg, komm hier raus
Komm, ich zeig dir was
Das du verlernt hast, vor lauter Verstand!,Komm mit
Komm mit mir ins Abenteuerland
Auf deine eigene Reise
Komm mit mir ins Abenteuerland
Der Eintritt kostet den Verstand
Komm mit mir ins Abenteuerland
Und tu's auf deine Weise
Deine Phantasie schenkt dir ein Land
Das Abenteuerland,Neue Form, verspielt und wild,
Die Wolken mal'n ein Bild.
Der Wind pfeift dazu dieses Lied,
In dem sich jede Wunsch erfüllt.
Ich erfinde, verwandle mit Zauberkraft,
Die Armee der Zeigefinger brüllt:""Du spinnst!""
Ich streck' den Finger aus
Ich verhexe, verbanne, ich hab die Macht
Solange der Kleine da im Spiegel da noch grinst!,Komm mit
Komm mit mir ins Abenteuerland
Auf deine eigene Reise
Komm mit mir ins Abenteuerland
Der Eintritt kostet den Verstand
Komm mit mir ins Abenteuerland
Und tu's auf deine Weise
Deine Phantasie schenkt dir ein Land
Das Abenteuerland,Peter Pan und Captain mit siebzehn Feuerdrachen,
Alles kannst du sehen, wenn du willst.
Donnervögel, Urgeschrei, Engel, die laut lachen,
Alles kannst du hören, wenn du willst.
Du kannst flippen, flitzen, fliegen und das grösste Pferd kriegen.
Du kannst tanzen, taumeln, träumen und die Schule versäumen.
Alles das ist möglich in dir drin, in deinem Land,
Trau dich nur zu spinnen, es liegt in deiner Hand.,Komm mit ... auf deine eigne Reise.
Komm mit, und tu's auf deine Weise!,Komm mit
Komm mit mir ins Abenteuerland
Auf deine eigene Reise
Komm mit mir ins Abenteuerland
Der Eintritt kostet den Verstand
Komm mit mir ins Abenteuerland
Und tu's auf deine Weise

When the chips are down, I'll be around
With my undying, death-defying
Love for you,Envy will hurt itself
Let yourself be beautiful
Sparkling love, flowers
And pearls and pretty girls
Love is like an energy
Rushin', rushin' inside of me,The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on burnt desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal,I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
When the chips are down, I'll be around
With my undying, death-defying
Love for you,Envy will hurt itself
Let yourself be beautiful
Sparkling love, flowers
And pearls and pretty girls
Love is like an energy
Rushin', rushin' inside of me,This time, we go sublime
Lovers entwine, divine, divine
Love is danger, love is pleasure
Love is pure, the only treasure
I'm so in love with you
Purge the soul
Make love your goal,The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
The power of love
A force from above
A sky-scraping dove,Flame on burnt desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal,I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door"

Trotzdem kennt man sie gut
Denn sie macht sich lieber Feinde
Und sie frisst am liebsten Mut
Keiner kann sie leiden
Doch sie hat jeden gern
Sie kennt auch jeden Menschen
Ganz egal ob nah ob fern,Refrain:
Ich bin dein kleines Lied
Ich stärk dich bei Gefahr
Egal was auch geschieht
Ich bin für dich da
Einmal in deinen Ohren
Geh ich da nie mehr raus
Denn ich hab es mir geschworen
Ich schütze dich und dein Haus,Deine Angst ist wohl auch meine
Denn sie lebt von dir und mir
Im Dunkeln und alleine
Nagt sie an mir und dir
Wir könnten uns verbünden
Wir beide Du und ich
Und unsere Angst ergründen
Ich lass dich nicht im Stich,Refrain:

Ich stärk dich bei Gefahr
Egal was auch geschieht

Einmal in deinen Ohren
Geh ich da nie mehr raus
Denn ich hab es mir geschworen
Ich schütze dich und dein Haus,Jetzt bist du meine Heimat
Denn in dir geht es mir gut
Dein Herz ist meine Einfahrt
Dein Lauschen wird mein Mut
Wir beide unzertrennlich
Jagen alle Ängste fort
Denn ich weiss du erkennst mich
Auch am dunkelsten Ort,Refrain:
Ich bin dein kleines Lied
Ich stärk dich bei Gefahr
Egal was auch geschieht
Ich bin für dich da
Einmal in deinen Ohren
Geh ich da nie mehr raus

Through the middle of me
The whole world loves a sad song
That they don't have to sing
We hide in the hot house
Loaded with thrills
Second only to none
Here in this hot house
We sit and sing and rant and rave
In our lovely hot house
Closed my eyes
Walking to the store
Found our mattress
Beside those old deadly trakes
We slept for a week
Cinders on the sheets
You went away and called and said
You had to stay another day

Beware of danger's the only sign I see

To reach the goals of these soccer stars
There's records to break, medals to take
Flags to wave, the city is ours
There's ceilings to climb, the road winds
Only lights is those from a Beamer

My God bigger than your God down here
Whom shall I fear?

Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko na
Kung ikaw ang kasama
(Adlib),At may biglang sumingit
Natiempo pa sa'ting gitna
Sumimangot tuloy
Ang aking mukha,Mabuti nalang nagbayad yung ale
Sabi nya paabot naman
Nagkadahilan ako
Para ika'y tignan,Nung iaabot ang bayad
Kamay mo na palang nakaabang
Pambihira diba swerte ko naman,Sabi nila'y walang pag-ibig
Kung wala'y
Ba't kumakaba itong dibdib,Ayoko nang pumara kahit san mapunta
Ayoko nang pumara kung ikaw ang kasama
Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko na ahhh
Ayoko nang pumara kahit san pa lumiko
Ayoko nang pumara sana din a huminto
Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko na
Kung ikaw ang kasama,Manong driver
Wag mo nang ibalik ang sukli ko
Manong driver
Di mo ba alam walang babaan to
Drive lang po ng drive
Wag niyong hihinto
Kahit sa'n mapadpad
Kahit lumipad man tayo
Minsan lang madama
Ang ganito,Pero bigla mong
Hinila ang tali
Sabi mo
""Manong bababa ako sandali"",Ayoko nang pumara kahit san mapunta
Ayoko nang pumara kung ikaw ang kasama
Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko na ahhh
Ayoko nang pumara kahit san pa lumiko
Ayoko nang pumara sana din a huminto
Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko na
Ayoko nang pumara kahit san mapunta
Ayoko nang pumara kung ikaw ang kasama
Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko nang pumara
Ayoko na ahhh

Love is kind
It does not envy
It does not boast
It is not proud
It is not rude
It is not self-seeking
It is not easily angered
It keeps no record of wrongs
Love does not delight in evil
But rejoices with the truth
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres.
Panghabang buhay ang pag-ibig ko sa 'yo o sinta
Kahit na tupakin ka, iintindihin kita
Panghabang buhay ang pag-ibig ko sa 'yo o sinta
Kahit na may kasalanan ka, iiyak ako pero papatawarin ka

Bakit ayaw huminto?

And all my sleepless nights
I'll be waiting for your call
I'll be dreaming about you

Khul ke peete hain ek baap ke
Pet bhar ke peeta main phir
Floor pe naachun taap taap ke
Zindagi ke saare din jee rakh hain
Ek jaam, do jaam, teen jaam, chaar
Bas itne hi peg maine pee rakhe hain
Main toh kabhi ni rukta
Kisi ke aage na jhukta
Mera gaaya huaa gaana, laakhon mein bikta
Cause I'm Honey Singh!

Khol botal o yaara thori si tu daal de
Khol botal han kathe ho gaye munde naal de
Khol botal o yaara thora sa karar de
Khol botal (khol raha hu yaar),Bob that thing, pour the liquor in my glass baby
Bob that thing, doing nothing like the last baby
Bob that thing, when we see you shake your ass baby
Bob that thing, don't stop that thing
We can sip that thing
I'm getting love from the goofy
Badshah wont stop, coz we got alot Roofies
the alcohol like keep the grease on the roll
And everybody in the party going out of control
Let me see you flip'n up sip'n up as much as u can
Let me see you buzzer like a rubber band drinking a hand
Let me see you drink as tumble and named you as tumbler
Absolutely nothing left to feel the drummers,Khol botal o yaara thori sit u daal de
Yara thora soda daal ke tu thora sa hilla yaara (botal hilla le)
Hone de nasha, lene de maza, peene de tu, jeene de tu, aaj mat rok yaara
Mafia aur behisab sharab hai
Khehne ko kharab hai par chiz laa jawab hai
Saki se mukabla hai hum bhi hai taiyar
Dekhe kiski hogi jeet, kiski hogi haar
Khol botal o yaara thori si tu daal de
Khol botal han kathe ho gaye munde naal de
Khol botal o yaara thora sa karar de
Khol botal (khol raha hu yaar)
Bob that thing, pour the liquor in my glass baby
Bob that thing, doing nothing like the last baby
Bob that thing, when we see you shake your ass baby
Bob that thing, don't stop that thing,Chai kam ya daru peene mere sath mere yaar
Choti choti baatoon par dekho ladne ko hai taiyaar (acha)
Dost hai kamal ke 21 22 saal ke
Koi bhi na dekhe aankho me aankhe daal ke
Mai nahi peeta par yaar mere sharabi
Humse panga loge ho jayegi kharabi
Dekho dekho mere thath dekho nawabi
Yaar sari raat chalega paani gulabi,Gramma mama mama pose some look
Stepping in the my fucking game man now is getting thicker
I'm getting all lazy, the vision all hazy
The glass getting all over and bill is getting bigger
When we grin that vow upside down and squeeze
Hanesy tascy never ever it is
See the party tango, we getting no high
Put down with the look and throw hands in the sky
You say khol botal o yaara thori si tu daal de
Khol botal han kathe ho gaye munde naal de
Khol botal o yaara thora sa karar de
Khol botal
Bob bob bob
Bob that thing, pour the liquor in my glass baby
Bob that thing, doing nothing like the last baby
Bob that thing, when we see you shake your ass baby
Bob that thing, don't stop that thing

Alert! Bomb first
Trained to go, fuck hesitation
Ten steps ahead, not just of enemy, but of all men
Set an example by demonstration, not conversation
Fear of God, but with God keep a faithful relation
Do the unthinkable, pop up on that ass out the blue like peek-a-boo
All a man gots is his dick and his word
So whatever that man says, he gots to do
And if that pussy is yours, protect it by all means
Keep them real niggas, some top lawyers, financial advisors and them get-the-job-done riders on your team
And now you're ready for the world, ya-da-da-mean

You a fax machine, we can't call it, nigga
Everybody ain't a friend, reason why I keep a fo'
You wanna gamble with your life, bet that on the tender-fold, nigga
She bouncing that ass, go ahead shake it
And if she give me that back, bitch, I'mma break it
Shit, that pussy is overrated, some niggas'll chase it

Catch you slippin' from your backside, they knock you out
Ace gon' stomp you out then Buddah gon' stomp you out

Nine milli pokin' out, fo-fizzy pokin' out
Death Row days, show you what this West Coast about,I'd die for my motherfuckin' nigga
Jump in front a bullet for my motherfuckin' nigga,On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga
Real talk, I don't really fuck with too many niggas
Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughin' to the bank like the fuckin' money tickle
Drivin' somethin' that you ain't, top boss, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro, don't beef over no hoe
And my niggas sell them keys if you can't open your door
Hope you buy for my motherfuckin' niggas

I know the homies might think a nigga's krazy
But you could fuck around and have my first baby
What?,I said face down ass up
That's the way we likes to fuck
Do my dirt on the low
That's the way shit's 'sposed to go,But I be tryna hit it right at the wrong time
I said it's yours, you say it's mine, Shit we both lying

My girl tryna FaceTime hitting both lines,Meanwhile, while YG is fucking his side bitch

We was her babies, she just wanted to hold us
And we ain't get disciplined, her friend started whisperin'
About how she was a bad mama, mama said ""fuck 'em then""
I was in the streets stylin', nobody could tell me nothin'
Grandpa or grandma, not my auntie or my favorite cousin
I was buzzin'
Fuckin' all these hoes wearing no condoms, no nothin'
I used to ditch school when the homie had the Chevy
I used to sneak and smoke stress weed,But now I'm rollin' on dubs
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
Now I'm rollin' on dubs
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
All these hoes showin' love
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
All these hoes showin' love
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?,SKKKRRRT, I was on a mission
On a mission to the money, sun down till it sunny
Know my family love me
Ridin' in the car with two niggas and a pistol
This ain't funny, I do it all for the money, hold up
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand, I already know the plan
Hop out and get on your mans and take what he got
Go through pockets, wallets and socks, dig all the knots
It's a stick-up, phone ring, it's my mama
In the middle of some drama, so I don't pick up
Thinking I gotta get my shit up, I gotta pick my bitch up
Let's hurry up and leave, I feel the police near us
So we left with a thousand dollars cash
It was me and my nigga, so you know I went half
Then shit get real when niggas get greedy
Pop, pop, pop, pow, that's when he leave me"

I went to sleep last night with no bitch, nigga, I was a loner
I be going through shit, losin' bitches and homies
If I don't make it with this rap shit, nigga, I might be homeless
My moms don't got a job, my pop's checks ain't enough
If ain't bringin' home that money, my whole family is fucked
I swear I move like the mob, I'm watchin' movies too much
If niggas wanted you dead, what would you suggest?
They wonder why I do drugs and hang with thugs
Since I made it the city hated, wait, where is the love?
I ride around with my gun, this is not for fun
I stay protected cause my homie just took one to the lung
Had him on life support, where's the family support?
He knew who shot him, but he ain't even show up in court
Yeah, that's a real G, nigga, he on a kill spree, nigga
The homie popped him so I hope he don't kill me, nigga,x2
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be going through some things, you don't know what I've been thinkin',Now I'm ridin' through traffic with 2Pac blastin'
With a bitch that's irritatin' from all these questions she askin'
Like what bitches I fucked, when, how and where
You ain't my main bitch so why the fuck do you care
That's why bitches get fucked, then turn around and get left
Somebody need to teach them less talk, more sex
I'm pressed when I'm stressed, my granny tell me I'm blessed
Well, why the fuck do Jesus Christ got me goin' through this shit?
Everybody need favors, what happens if I go broke?
Or say I ain't got it, then buy my lolo some new spokes
Right up in your fake setup, fuck you up like some mace
So fuck your handout, give a young nigga some space
Give a nigga some Ace, give me a blunt that's laced
Sprinkle some molly in it, watch me take this shit to my face
The snitch is the shooter, they took time away from his case
Holy shit, oh lawd, where is the world today?,I swear this industry shit, to me is one big ass lick
I walk inside of a buildin', tell the A&R; nigga strip
Tell 'em I need all of my chips, my life been known Section 8
I've been a welfare case, AFDC pump fake
Meanwhile I'm grindin' cause drug money ain't like rap money
Four white kilo snow bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up, I got a bad call, they killed Braze
They killed Chad my big homie Pup
Puppy eyes in my face, bruh, and I've really been drinkin'
Why the fuck I've really been smokin'?
What the fuck, I'm the sober one
When I'm so stressed out I can't focus
Hideout when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
Speed past in the Cutlass-me and little Ocho
And we young nigga hop out
2 tears in a bucket, I feel like fuck it
That's the price of fame, recognize my pain, that's all I know
All alone, but I'm out here though
Call my troops like vamonos
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, and it's all bad
Off OG with my OG and some OE, by the tall glass"

Whole head tattooed like a fucking Cholo
Never hate the next man nigga that's a no no
Got ya girl bouncing on my dick like a low low
Mustard on the beat, mustard get a fucking check
I got bitches, take bitches nigga wanna bet?
Ice on my neck got ice in my ears
Hit the club niggas looking at me hella weird
It's YG 400, bitch, get it right
You at the club every weekend? Bitch get a life
Ever since she fucked with me she never been the same
Well, god damn, just blame it on my ding-a-lang,I'm so froze diamonds look so lemon
Used to text cause my phone had low minutes
Niggas need swishers so we at the store with it
If you don't drop on the blunt then you don't hit it
Flyer than a eagle, riding in a regale
Money over bitches, nigga, you don't think we know
Pockets full of c-notes, oops, I mean p-notes
Bitch in the whip looking hot like a Cheeto
Louie bag and a briefcase, bitch
I get money like a sweepstakes
Everyweek a nigga eat steak
What's dessert? Shit, I wonder how she taste
I don't want her, you can get her
Bitch you ugly like yo' daddy Reggie Miller
Like Pittsburg bet I steal her
And fuck her in the whip brand new from the dealer,I'm good on the I'm the shit!
YG 400, bitch! I'm real!

Nigga, trip then a shoot, nigga with the tech
Hey, motherfucker, don't you move

And karma is a motherfucking biatch
You got your homie in jail, you sniatch
All in the court telling the judge who it is
Like a bitch when you get to the pen, niggas on your wig
Niggas be lurking, bitches be slurping
Niggas got caught up on them Nextels chirpin
It's a must in the county, I ain't have no pagers
My bitch wouldn't come see me, I was in there masturbating
Smoking on a bigarette, eating a bowl of bereal
Niggas on the block selling O's like Cheerios

Speaking for some people that you prolly ain't know

And if we say go then they're prolly gong go
You vote Trump then you're prolly on dope
And if you like me then you prolly ain't know
And if you been to jail you can prolly still vote
We let this nigga win, we gong prolly feel broke
You built walls? We gong prolly dig holes
And if your ass do win, you gong prolly get smoked
Fuck nigga, fuck you!,I will build a great, great wall on our southern border
And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words,Hold up, I fuck with Mexicans, got a plug with Mexicans
Want a little, need a switch, who I call? A Mexican
This Comedy Central ass nigga couldn't be the President
Hold up, Nip, tell the world how you fuck with Mexicans
It wouldn't be the USA without Mexicans
And if it's time to team up, shit, let's begin
Black love, brown pride in the sets again
White people feel the same as my next to kin
If we let this nigga win, God bless the kids
God bless the kids, this nigga wicked and wigged

Where the Crips say, ""errrb""
And the bitch niggas get on my nerves,I'm buying choppers like tennis shoes
And I hate doing interviews
Cause criminals don't like talking
I don't go to funerals, I don't like coffins
You wasn't catching fades in the county
Niggas told you ""roll it up"" and you was out it
I got Crips they be TG'd up
I heard you hit the county and be PC'd up
Your bitch fuck me cause I'm poppin'
I be on the block when the police watching
And if you cross the street, there's a store there
But that's the enemy store we don't go there
Nigga I'm from Bompton
I know ese's and all my enemies bitches wanna sex me
All my YG's give it up, enemies hit 'em up
West side Tree Top gang, we don't give a fuck"

Cause' she already know me,
I put on for my city,
Run these streets like Diddy,
And I got a whole bunch of goon niggaz rollin' with me,
Yeah I'm best dressed,
Back up I need 2 steps,
Swag on sharp and my breath on Winterfresh,
I'm in this bitch like a crook in your neck,
Broke nigga tryin' to be rich about my own check,
Cuz' Big Beat said we up next,
Yeah I'm tatted on my hands on stomach and my chest,
Look me up girl,

Your girl on my jock I bet she want the homie next check,[Chorus]

Catch me in a charger on dubs,
And every time I'm out I shine like the sun,
I only talk to girls,
That like me,
And if she bad she stayin' with me,
Cause' girl I'm a G,
I'm a thug,
Nothing like your other man,

If you ain't heard around here I'm the man (so),
If you ain't heard girlfriend I'm the man,[Chorus],[Verse 3]

Hold up, bitch, that nigga [?] just got hit
You can talk to the boss, shit I ain't gon' trip
All that talkin' out your mouth, you can suck this dick
All my life, all my life
Stack this money, I don't need no wife
All my life, all my life
Fucked you once, might fuck you twice,If I ever gave a fuck about one bitch, nigga I would be dumb
If I ever gave a fuck about one bitch, nigga I would be dumb,And know it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Charlie Hood, I'm goin' hard on a bitch
She fakin' that nut to keep her relationship
Now ain't that some shit, never loved no trick
That's why I'm fuckin' bitches, ballin' hard, James Worthy
Put her on the team and now she tryna rock my jersey
Sayin' that she loyal but she's really thirsty
Suck a nigga dick cause I don't show her no mercy
One for the money, two for the show
Hangin' out the window like, ""mothafuck a ho""
Gettin' money every day cause that's all a nigga knows
Stash spot got the heat, cause all my niggas trained to go
And that's for them hoes, yeah I'm through with it
There's nothin' left to do with it, pass it to the bro
Now you hit it, cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches get flipped by me,If I ever gave a fuck about one bitch, nigga I would be dumb
If I ever gave a fuck about one bitch, nigga I would be dumb"

Gimmie said he going through it, life hard, he be starting to lose it
But every time I give him cash, he dry broke, he a doofus
So I say no and Gimmie took it how he took it
I said no for a reason, but he ain't asked, he said said ""Fuck me""
And guess what I found out? Nigga what you find out?
Gimmie and my ex bitch was fucking, oh, ah, it touch me
Do i press him? Do I pop him? I need advice Father
Uhh...I thought you ain't love me no more nigga
I didn't know what to do, I had to fuck one of your bitches
See Gimmie all along was a cold nigga
Didn't give him what he wanted so Gimmie stole from niggas
And that's when I pulled out my Glock
Now everybody know how Gimmie got shot,

Niggas actin' like they're pimps but they paid the bitch
Some of us ain't in the position that we say we're in
In one year I done moved in 3 different residences
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Mercedes Benz,Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw their time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I just want a dime on me
Snitchin' throw their time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I gotta keep the fire on me,I'm ridin' dirty on the L-O
Cause the judge givin' niggas body parts, elbows
So I paid 15 hundred for my stash spot
This janky dude, if you fuck with it, it'll pop out
Ooh I got a strike and a felony
But the homie ridin' with me say his record clean
So you would take this case is what you tellin' me
Oooh, you better not tell on me
You went to jail for a nickel, came home too quick
And you wonder why your homeboys never wanna tell you shit
But you wasn't too sure so the homies still let him lurk
'Til niggas saw that paperwork
Told the DA, he was just drivin', he plotted, he did it
He even threatened to fuck me up if I wasn't with it
Now it's all bad in the hood and he can't come around
Conversation's like, ""somethin', somethin', somethin', gun that nigga down"",I made it through my situation and I stayed down
For niggas [?] it's nothing much you can say now
I'm so accustomed to sucka' niggas that hate now
I pokerface and then touch 'em, my niggas play foul
It ain't no rules cause these niggas threw the rules away
If I could pick a place and time I would choose today
See I'm the type of nigga die for his jewelry
Gang related homicide is what the news'll say
Playing with my reputation ain't amusing me
Playing with a nigga patience who are you to say
Short temper, fuck it, I'ma blow a fuse today
And when I lose my mind I'ma shoot a face
I seen 'em get away with murder cause he knew the way
Killed a nigga, went to trial, then he beat the case
So what type of example do it set, nigga
Play with mine, you can fuckin' get wet nigga
Yes, nigga"

Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep

Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in,People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck you, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' the gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow,I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch
'em overdose (shoot 'em up yeah, yeah)
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and
watch 'em overdose (fill 'em up yeah, yeah)
Overdose, I kill 'em slow,What's the 4-1-1, they know I be, I be 'bout whatever

Send your ass to the devil, in envelope like a letter
Got an FN with a clip with different colors up in it

Flexin' on these niggas, pockets full of blue hundreds
Ain't no goin' back, you know I'm gon' keep it comin'
Ain't no time to wait, so nigga play, we gon' burn him,Today Friday so you know we on that Clyde and Dodo
I got black and white bitches knockin' at my door though
I'm in the middle of the room posted with a .44
I got it out in case a nigga wanna take a photo
Remember me and 3Three we used to ride up in a stolo
Now I'm in a two-door coupe, it used to be a four-door
Don't pay for cable, he want static, tell him let me know though
I'm quick to let a nigga have it, you know I'ma blow though
Late at night I used to sneak out my grandfather window
And I was coolin' on a flight, and I was hittin' them licks though
Wasn't for him I wouldn't be shit, so I ain't gotta trip though
Ten thousand dollars, that ain't shit, I gave him that times three though,Through the night when it be stormin'

Plus my PO and the police knockin' at my door though
I get creative on the track just like a blunt of dope though
I told Nini I'm comin' back, she think I'm with a hoe though
Hundred grand in my pocket when I wanna flex
Back in the day them niggas laughed when I said I'm next
Up with the choppa 'case that boy try reach for my neck
You know how I pop, fuck that shit, I put his ass to rest,Turned up like we want it, we pulled up on that dumb shit

I felt like I can do it all, so I ain't want no help
I always thought that I can fall, I would stay to myself
I never trusted none of y'all 'cause I was worried 'bout death
So many people not around who said they stay, but they left
I keep my bible on my right and keep my Glock on my left
I thought that human's feelings fake, so when they say, I ain't care
Now I'm regettin' that I ain't say, I never told how I felt
I'ma do my shit until these bitches get so mad that they melt,[Verse]
I see these bitches start to change soon as the fame appealin'
Go against the grain, I'll bust yo' brain
Won't tell the pain I'm feelin'
You changed yo' clique, I stayed the same, my niggas hang a nigga
My nigga ain't won't bust his brain but them prices temptin'
Am I the reason everybody come around and start to leavin'?
I don't know(I don't know)
I ever found out that you was leechin', I won't stop 'til we get even and you know(and bitch you know)
That I
I was 100 'til I got broken hearted, yeah
You couldn't much finish all the shit that you started, uh-huh
Focused on this because I think they disarm me
I shoot this bitch all by myself with no army
Before I sleep, though, I think everything you was sayin'
I was too deep, though, she ain't understand who I am
I'm in the streets, though, I came a long way from the can
Memories keep me happy, so I'm doin' my dance
She here for me, though, I told her, ""Hit me up when you land,""
And she so street, though, I filled her bank account up with bands
I feel I can't, dog, she always tell me that I can
She all for me, she said, ""Let's rock and roll,"" I don't give a damn
You know that I'm thuggin', you know that I'm with it, you talk to them bitches and say how I'm livin'
You let all of them hoes fuck with yo' mind and go against me and you listen
Life on the line, cases still pendin'
But I stole a car, we still spinnin'
Talkin' to you, 'fore you left, you was in it
We gon' hit the gas soon as I spit it
Warm it up, wanna ass 'til they feel it
Want smoke, give 'em gas, I feel it
Thought that I came to the town that I did it
Straight out the north, I did time in the prison
All is well, must love, no tension(yessir)
Murder Gang(yessir) and everyone(yessir) in my business(yessir)
Maserati truck(yessir) soon as I hit it(yessir)

23 shots, Lebron James I shoot the cavalier
These niggas speakin' on my name I'ma get it clear
When they shot, they aimed for my brain but I'm still here
I'm a Bad Boy, never met Diddy but that's what it is,[Chorus]
Used to be broke but now I'm rich, I'm spendin' every penny
2Pac Shakur, ridin' through the North up in the Bentley
Curtis Jackson ain't no actin' when I'm on a mission
Tryna assassinate my character, I ain't say I did it
Nigga, you got that yayo? (well cut some nigga)
Nigga, you let them Ks go? (bust some nigga)
Oh, you duckin' them laws? (you better run from them nigga)
Oh, you playin' with that raw? (go and front some nigga),[Bridge]
The block is hot, the block is hot
The block is hot, the block is hot
The block is hot, the block is hot
The block is hot, the block is hot,[Verse 2]
I'm in the all white Porsche wit' heat ridin' through Hollygrove
Discussin' 'bout what it's gon' take to get them birds gone
Say look, look daddy, I ain't your wardie make me bust your dome
Got a 100 shots up in the Caddy while I'm headed home
My lil' hitter quiet like Slim, we gon' shoot above the rim
We gon' pop 'em when we see 'em
Whip his pockets 'fore we kill 'em
We got the police on our trail, so we runnin' when we see 'em
Don't wanna front us now run, we gon' rob 'em when we see 'em, bitch
Police hit our stash house but we ain't closing shop
They got some niggas movin' work to stay right up the block
Knock on the door, I need a zone yeah I got the guap
Soon as he open up the door, he gon' see the Glock,[Chorus]
Nigga, you got that yayo? (well cut some nigga)
Nigga, you let them Ks go? (bust some nigga)
Oh, you duckin' them laws? (you better run from them nigga)

Count it up and throw me lean

Smiled at my circle and cut off some people

Get out this body, I bet that I spank em
Come in the night and you entering danger
Live like a Rebel and strapped like a Ranger
Stare in your face and can tell what you thinking
Got any sisters princess Jelena? woof, woof

Dropped out of school to chase my dream, I had some for to prove
I put my all in this shit, man I can't fuckin' lose
They smile up in my face but they don't know what I been through
Whole lotta nights I went to sleep and I ain't had no food
But now I'm up and I'm just thinking about my next move
Gotta keep my head above water, gotta make it through
I do this shit for my momma and my lil' brother too
Ain't no more problems now I might as well go back to school
Gotta maintain, stay on my grind no I can't be no fool
Naw I can't slip nor I can't fumble, gotta stick and move
Get out BR, move to LA, where I ain't gotta keep a tool

Now I'm in back of the Maybach with a lot of bands
I ain't worry 'bout 'em dissin' naw, I don't hear a thing they sayin'
This for sons in Montana and can't forget [Lil Ben]

This for that North, 38 baby, they know I ain't playing
From the heart I appreciate all of my fans
This for Monique for loving me and bein' my helping hand
I really did it, this for for mom's, Three, Trey and Aaron
Can't nobody tell me nothing I'm like what you sayin',

No security with me so I'm strapped up with that tool
Try to take my jewelry off and you gon' make the news
Cuban links around my neck, it cost me 22
Audemar Piguet, coulda' went and bought a school
Went to Neiman Marcus for my pants and my shoes
Five thousands dollars, what I paid for the whole fit
I just took a loss so I'm goin' on a heist
Hold a tool in yo face like chino do a bike
Too much money on me for to raise my hands and fight
Thunder in my clip, fuck around get hit with light,Draw down with that Glock, bitch don't make no sound

When I die, I'ma leave you my money,[Chorus]
Pour up my cup and I sip it (I sip it)
Whatever I want, I go get it (I go get it)
Came from rags to riches (rags to riches)
Blew up and took over my city (my city)
I'm thankin' the lord I did it (I did it)
I wanted a bite, and I bit it (I bit it)
I swear it ain't hard to get it (to get it)
I stay with that rod, I'm with it (I'm with it),[Verse 2]
I swear I won't stop 'til I get it
This fortune and fame ain't rented
I'm lovin' this pain I'm feelin'
I'm way outta range, I'm winnin'
I wanted a bite, and I bit it
Had to jump out a plane and get it
Lay on top of that [?] commitment
I'ma blow out the brain and hit it
I count up that money like every night
My diamonds gon' shine like a headlight
Focus on keepin' my head right
I know for a fact it's gon' be alright
Make sure my son gon' be alright
Lord forgive me for takin' lives
CashAP got the beat tight
Workin', I ain't goin' to sleep tonight,[Chorus]
I pour up my cup and I sip it (I sip it)
Whatever I want, I go get it (I go get it)
Came from rags to riches (rags to riches)
Blew up and took over my city (took over my city)
I'm thankin' the lord I did it (I did it)
I wanted a bite, and I bit it (I bit it)
I swear it ain't hard to get it (hard to get it)

Free all my bros it's still fuck 12
Sippin' syrup while I gather my thoughts

Get that dough and perform then I leave

I've been walkin like a head light
Get a different head everynight
Gotta understand I love this life
Treat the 5 star hotel like's a motherfuckin projects
I recognize that Im blessed?
Im very different from the rest
Put my niggas on jets
Just to motivate the thugs
Just to show the nigga love,Risk my life on my partna' care if he is right or wrong
So much pain in my body I've been like this too long
So much trynna stop me but I keep movin on
I never give up I gotta keep it strong
The anxiety gonna ride
Take a risk and you gave me your life
Forever thuggin on site
My heart cold at night"

Nigga said spin again when the sun down
All night we gone wait till' he come out
See his ass hop out on him with the Glock out

Where I'm from I was taught never stand down
Once my youngin spin believe I'm coming back around
Suppressor on the front take away the sound

How I feel I should be up there less than a year
I gotta get it nigga knowing what it is
Got a family counting on me so you knowing whats the deal Draw down, give it up, nigga knowing what the drill

I'm from Baton Rouge where they wildin' off the pills
You ain't from where I'm from
You don't feel how I feel
Everyday strapped up
You don't live how I live
Police killing us and the police getting killed
I got so many niggas waiting on an appeal
Most of my niggas dead and we still shedding tears
Watch ya homeboy he fake, he ain't really real
Shit I ain't trippin' I'm just focused on my career
Just stopped by Booma, bought a 9 with a dick it
32 shots in the Glock I won't be a victim
Ain't no waiting Ima shoot till' a nigga tempt me
When I up two tips out the clip zip em
Soon as the pack tryna tax you know we gone rip ya

Tell them niggas we the motherfucking sickest in the city
And we don't do no motherfucking scare business

All day working I ain't taking calls right now
KD got the cannabis card, where the smoke at?
In California I'm with Eli we on Fairfax
Walking out the Supreme store with two bags
Make that shit, spend that shit, get it right back
Montana asking everybody where the hoes at
Kill time smoking joe's where the laws at?
Hollywood Boulevard walking with that sack
Tell the truth I'm just living it up
I'm just stating facts
When I spit ima snap when I'm on the track
Another youngin fucking with me tell me where he at

All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out,[Verse 1]
I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me
To think he was from your past
Silly of me to dream
Of one day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong,[Verse 2]
I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe
That with you I'm a changed man
Foolish of you to compete
When I cheat with loose women
It took me some time
But now I moved on
Because I realized I got,[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend,[Verse 3]
So controlling, you said
That you love me but you don't
Your family told me
One day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing
With some problems of my own
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong,[Verse 4]
Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front
Like you're still with me
All your girlfriends know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I realized I got,[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend,[Bridge]
(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again,[Break]
Yea-ea
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh

And I wonder why I'm all messed up
Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Being a class act nevermind my alumni
I don't wanna be around a baby so dumb high
That I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed

Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no

No joke, who laughs? Just us,[Verse 4]
Okay, got this OJ and Jose
Mixed it up with that Rose
We gon' do this our own way
Alright, okay
What is it that you're smoking?
Piece it up with this peace and love

Up all night, all night and every day

But my side should be heard
Think that it's fucking absurd
You talk about me when you rap about her
All of your songs, hear about all of my wrongs
Like you never played me like porn
Like you never went out and did nothing wrong
It's crazy forever turned into so long
Now that you're gone I had to move on
And I'm happy with him
But I still can't pretend that I didn't go fuck with your friend
Every now and again
I be thinking that then,
I be thinking that that was something I would never intend
And especially when it was me who you trusted
To take all your feelings and try to remend it
It's so hard to pretend
I would lie in your bed giving you head
Listen to all of the things that you said
Listen to all of the lyrics you read
You were chasing a dream
I would party instead
Young and in love
Young and we're dumb
I could taste all of the pain on your tongue
I could taste all of my pain in the rum
Knew it was over before it begun
Looking for fun, burning my lungs
Learning my favorite feeling was numb
I bought every dinner, you barely bought one
Maybe I cheat and then we could be done
That would be done, we were so broke
You were the one that turned into a joke
I kept us afloat
You were the one that kept busting a rope
Damn
Now you're the man, huh?
I see you turned into somebody I can't stand
Knowing you made us all part of your plan
You crazy fuck
I had the chance I should of ran, huh?
Never would tell me you cared
Never were there
Remember that night that we went to the fair?
Every fine girl that walked by you would stare
See, even with them, Mark, you never were there
If all I cared about was my makeup and hair
All you cared about was the ego you wear
You tear me apart and continue to tear
Now I'm with someone who actually cares
Fuck you!
But I can't keep you off my mind
I'm seeing everything you drop
Sometimes I wish that I was blind
You make me relive my mistake
A million trillion fucking times
See you're a coward,
And a stupid rapper soul is what you hide behind
And my whole family still adores you
I tried a million times I would of only did that for you
I can't act like I don't know you
Every night I would explode
You made me feel I was below you
Mark I wish I could ignore you
But I...
Can't... Damn...,Would you have it
Cause you tell me you love me again and again
You were only a friend
It was all a pretend
I wrote so many letters but never hit send
I was never content
I was set on me being a rapper
I thought about music and thought of you after
It's funny how tears turn to laughter
And tears on a page they can turn into a masterpiece
That's how you told me to leave
I remember that night it's as clear as can be
You found a new man
And he loves that you drink
And he loves getting head
But don't care what you think
You look pretty in pink
You look naughty in red
We know these are the words that would never be said
And we're chasing a topic that's over your head
Cause you think about me every night as you lie in your bed
That's... Real.,Well I guess we all change,
Mark,
I guess we all change,
I hope that you get everything that you want
As you yell and you stand on the stage
You took all your pain
And turned it to fame
They're screaming your name
And going insane
I kept all our pics but threw out the frame
Before I knew it
I knew Mark never wanted the same
But what about me, mother fucker?
Forgot about me, mother fucker
Except when you talk about me, mother fucker
I'm tired of hearing about me, mother fucker
Your mouth was a blessing and now it's a weapon
Remember the time and the love we invested
I'm posting a pic and I'm getting attention
My tits and my ass get a favorite in seconds
See you were with me but were thinking of her
Now I'm with him and I'm thinking of you
Together to never whatever we were
We're stuck in a cycle
The cycle is cruel
A couple of fools
Stuck in a pool of people that wanna be cool.
See we're never happy, we're happy
So we keep on searching for love
As if love was a jewel
Remember that night that you came to my school?
Stayed up all night and we talked about life
My parents and I, we would constantly fight
You said when you make it
I might be a stay at home wife
Apparently that wasn't right
We lived in the moment that lasted a night
And honestly, Mark, gotta start to start to move on with your life
Sincerely,
A letter we never would write.
Like, what are we doing?
Like, what am I doing?
Writing these letters but what am I proving?
I'm stuck in my room and I'm spilling it all
Thinking of what you would say if you called
I might be the biggest mistake of them all.
My biggest mistake was to think that I never could fall
Like, falling for you
Falling in love
Follow my dream
And that's all of my love
I just want to feel I've been feeling so numb
To think that I know how you're feeling is dumb
We're done
Right from the start
Right from the heart
A light in the dark
They say that you open and tear you apart
Now this is our letter we sign it:
Sincerely, Mark
This is our letter, we sign it
Sincerely, Mark"

You were right on border
Give me all of this
Give me all of you

Don't mean no proof,Guilty for insanity
Not like a movie
Change the scene
Taste your sweet profanity
This is for good cause
Thinking they're doing a good job,They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion

Does that make it right for smoke?
Maybe, or am I just seeing shit?

Quick fix, headlights, shine bright (you're the fuckin' deer)

You your position, you'll be fishing for far too long
You're the bad guy in this movie

And the only solution is making shit confusing,Ain't about who's winning or losin'

When the scars are gone you can't see bruising
Wanted three things watches, chains and gold rings

A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality
Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity

Emotions splattered, same pattern
Can't even begin to spot 'em

No lies in my eyes (nothing but truth will leave my mouth)

Sudden not to see the elephant in this room
Disguised as your perfume
But the smell of it consumes, it takes all my mind
You can search the world but you will never find
I see everything you've done to me
Being there, you run at me
I don't need to pace, I don't need the stamina

Ignorant bliss we hold like axes
We do not feel the piece that matches
We must be one place exactly
We are ever free and sometimes reckless
Who are we?
If not souls beyond the reckoning
We try our best, our voices beckoning
Somehow still it ends trajectory
Curving lines and missing objective goals
Obscene holes is a system's cause
Divide the lanes and call one yours"

Who you came here with forget about him
What you searching for is on the way
But don't say a word, gone missing,Show me things your lips can't explain
You got a body that I'm dying to discover
There's an aura that's pulling me in
Ainve nakhre na kar mere naal ni,Drop the furl you ain't gotta pretend
Don't play around with me baby,I don't bite

trynin' to find if an answer could exist
it's only an illusion
but there's something about it
and I just can't find my way out,ohhh,It's in my head like
Woah Oh
Get me outta here like
oh oh
Get me outta here,
It's like I'm tryna see through these,
these smoke & mirrors
these smoke & mirrors
Ohh
It's like I'm tryna see through these,
these smoke & mirrors.,It's easy to play the fool
and be blinded by the truth
than to be to want to break the rules
ohh noo,'Cause there's more, more than what meets the eye
and I can't get it out of my mind
I can't get it out of my mind
no no,It's in my head like
Woah Oh
Get me outta here like
oh oh
Get me outta here,
It's like I'm tryna see through these,

Girl where your going is out-out of town
Lets tear it up all night and if you want more
Then baby you can come back tomorow and...,We can do it all over, over again
And we can do it all over, over again x2,Right foot down and my head held high
We'll be moving so fast its like we're touching the sky

If we work this out!,(Dude, what have you gotten us into')
(Come on, we can totally turn this thing around),I'd rather face a seven footer
Straight up in the post
That sure beats hangin' here
And burning someone's toast.
I needed benjamins, but
This ain't worth the stress
Maybe there's a better way
To fix this greasy mess,We're a champion team,
A well-oiled machine,
And we've faced tougher
Problems than this.
I know it's a grind, but
I'm sure we can find
A way to have fun
While we get this job done,We've got to work, work
To work this out
We'll make things right
The sun will shine
If we work, work
There'll be no doubt
We can all come together
If we work this out!!,(Let's work it!),Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
A little bit of sugar
A little bit of butter
It's the perfect recipe!,Pay day!
It'll taste so sweet
Pay day!
Good enough to eat
Gonna make some motion pictures
Hit the mall with all my sisters
Get tickets to the knicks and sixers
Kick it with the music mixers
Buy a ride that suits my style
Lounge around the pool and while
Make a date with my favorite girl
We've got it made!,Oohh
We've got to work, work
To work this out
We'll make things right,
The sun will shine
If we work, work
There'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out!
Work this!
Gotta work this!
We can work this out!"

That I'm the sea and you're the pearl.

A prince is a pauper, babe, without a chick to call his own

So, come closer baby, oh, and whisper in my ear

That you're my pride and I'm your joy

And I bid adieu to my friends,'Cause my bartender, she's from the islands

And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum,I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried,Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child,And know a mother's love,Well it's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me,Raise your glasses for a toast

Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love,I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring,Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried,Cold beer on a Friday night

Never been so happy
Never felt so high

Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody gonna miss me anyway,Mind on a permanent vacation

It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change you're geography
Maybe you might be,Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair

Never felt so high

Grab a backpack of lies

Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in,
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay,
She's answered by the tail lights
Shining through the window pane,He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then
She said you're ramblin' man
You ain't ever gonna change
You gotta gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin',At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln,
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin',
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same 'ol light a shinin',
He thinks of Colorado
And the girl he left behind in,He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather

Can I call you then
She said you're a ramblin' man

And you were born for leavin'(born for leavin'),Well it's a winding road
When your in the lost and found
You're a lover I'm a runner
And we go 'round 'n 'round
And I love you but I leave you
I don't want you but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here baby,Oh I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather

I ain't ever gonna change

And I was born for leavin' (born for leavin'),And when I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whispering pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait till then
I can't wait till then"

And I cherished every time

I'd rather stay and watch the waves, move the sand beneath my feet.
Reggae on the radio, laying low and feeling hot.
Easy living down in paradise.
Pour me another one, make it a strong one, we're gonna have some fun tonight.
Just like the other one, make it a double rum, we're gonna castaway tonight.
Castaway.
Ride the waves like we're young, as time flies by and soon we'll be older.
It's better to live in the moment
Than stuck in the past fast asleep as the world passes by.
AY YAY OH The reality is history.
OH YO AY Come and castaway with me.
AY YAY OH The good times are free and nobody can take that away.
OH YO AY Come and castaway with me.
Pour me another one, make it a strong one, we're gonna have some fun tonight.
Just like the other one, make it a double rum, we're gonna castaway tonight. (Castaway we gonna let the sunshine in.) Pour me another one, make it a strong one, we're gonna have some fun tonight.
Just like the other one, make it a double rum, we're gonna castaway tonight.
CASTAWAY."

And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby,You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh and lose yourself again
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby,There's a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it
And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain
The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby,You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in

If you get the notion
Stop on by and play a while
Simple tune to get your love light glowing
Keep your heart wide open
Disappear just like the tide
Let it roll on by
And jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh and lose yourself again
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
Southern wind sings again an island lullaby
Island lullaby"

And all the places that I ended up not the way Ma woulda had it

His ghosts will shake those rattling chains
Long after he's dead
No soul knows his trouble
High upon his throne
Loved by few and judged by many
He bares that weight alone,It's a lifelong expedition
Second-guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
And the pages keep on filling,Crying out
Ooh go and wake the king
Call to arms
For those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground
Yeah the walls are coming down
It's do or die
Do or die,Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown"

That makes my heart sing
Been looking for a melody
That makes the church bells ring
Not looking for the fame
Or the fortune it might bring
In love, in music, in life,Jesus preached the golden rule
Buddha taught it too
Gandhi said eye for an eye
Makes the whole world go blind
With a little understanding
We can break these chains that we've been handed
I've got the medication
Love is the remedy,Pray to be stronger and wiser
Know you get what you give
Love one another
Amen (amen), amen,I've been thinking about the mark
That I'll be leaving
Been looking for a truth
I can believe in
I got everything I need
Let this heart be my guide
In love, in music, in life,I'm not saying I'm a wise man
Heaven knows there's much that I'm still finding
Making my way down this winding road
Holding on to what I love
Yeah, and leaving the rest behind
For love, for music, for life,Pray to be stronger and wiser
Know you get what you give
Love one another,(Love is the remedy)
We're all in this world together
Life's a gift that we have to treasure
Happiness, now that is the measure
Love is the remedy
(Love is the remedy),Everyone can be forgiven
One love and one religion
Open up your heart and listen
Love is the remedy,Pray to be stronger and wiser
And know you get what you give
God is love one another
Amen (amen), amen, amen (amen)"

Should've let that red scarf fly away
Like any chance I had of keeping you
Like the Northern wind a blowin'
Yeah my lonely heart is frozen
Never knew I'd find a way to break yours too,Where the wind blows babe
You can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life

Close your eyes babe
Take a breath, say my name
And I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love
The city lights look like a country sky
Like staring at the stars turned upside down
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find it in your heart to stick around
I hate it had to end this way
Tomorrow is a brand new day
And the chances here at love are precious few
Someone's out there waiting
For a sweet good timing lady
To make you smile like I always wanted to,Where the wind blows babe

Our memory's, my lullaby that love won't lie
If it's love done right
You'll be waiting on the other side
Arms open wide, if love don't lie
Lie
We can fly,Where the wind blows babe
You can bet
I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life

Close your eyes babe

It was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She had found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me,I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it,Sometimes I feel like a clown
Who can't wash off his make-up
The life she wanted ‒ it was gone
Prince Charming ‒ I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
But like the tide her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go,I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
Now she sees right through me
Should I hold on to what we've got
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I saw goodbye in her eyes,I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He's gonna love the way you shine
So did I
So don't smile at me if it ain't what you need,(Goodbye)
With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me)
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me, goodbye in your eyes!)

I'll be coming back again
I'll be coming back again,Wild child

And fogging up the windows

Gonna last forever
We were pedal to the metal
And always together

And listen while you whisper
To another lonely setting sun
Whose heart is always distant
Memories won't be the death of me
As long as I could feel you
Long as I could feel you,Wild child
Do you still remember
Skip school, drink
And get high agenda
Oh, it made me feel so alive

Like my first real love
That I thought would make it
Our greatest gifts can be
Mistakes we're making
So when I look back I just smile

'Cause we got room for everyone
Let's make some memories, 'round this 9 foot pie
Pull up a chair and stay a while
At the family table
Family table,It's the corner stone
That held us all up
Through the best of times
And be that way when times got tough
We blew the candles out
In our walk through time
This family table's bound together
By lovin' never dies,So won't you come on in?

Close our eyes and bow our heads
Thank the Lord for everything He's done
And for everyone
At the family table,So please come on in
When your work is done
Go 'head and wash your hands
And gather 'round with everyone
Makin' memories, 'round this 9 foot pie
No other place can ease your mind
Like a family table
Family table

Skin like velvet made

Never did what daddy taught her

Brought her to me,The river was cold
And the river was wide
She flowed from the mountain
Straight across the great divide
And her heart ran cold
But her love runs deep
She's fire on the mountain
Wrecking everyone she meets,She's like rain when she rolls in

Makes the loneliest heart wonder

Might not be storm clouds inside

She's coming around the bend
She's holding lightning in both hands,Lord please know

The river has my heart
She's the keeper of my soul
On one side of the water
Sweet everlasting grace
The other side could end your life
Or steal your breath away,She's like rain when she rolls in

She'll tear the land in two
She's running to be running
Cause it's all she knows to do
She's a tumbleweed rolling
A river running wild
A hurricane blowing
She's the calm after the storm
Under an Appalachian sunset sky,She's like rain when she rolls in
But that sunshine in her thunder
Makes the loneliest heart wonder

Might not be storm clouds inside

Drives all day in a rusty Buick, feet don't reach the

To save my poor mother, from the junk yard man!

Thinking's the last thing that you wanna do
Yeah, thinking's the last thing that you wanna do,As I sit on the bed of this hospital room
Just shedding a tear for the bride and groom
and the tiny [?] voice starts to bellow and cry
its my finest work yet if the day I should die,And if I was thinking I'd be thinking thank god
for the muse and the miracle right here in my arms,Times like these are so sweet and so true
thinkings the last thing that you wanna do
Yeah, thinkings the last thing that you wanna do
Yeah, thinkings the last thing that you wanna do"

Some put on a suit, but he ran the other way
Drums drown out the yuppies
And the one's who couldn't dream
Cause the freedom music gave him was worth more than anything,They don't know
What they got
Until it's gone
Like it or not
You live on love
You try to do what's right
We're all here waiting for our silver invitation
To the big band in the sky,Rollin down the windows
Trying hard to fight the sleep
Money's never much for a band in Tennessee
Another night of playing
To a crowd with no ears
Wanna hear the songs they know
And fill their bellies full of beer,But they don't know
What they got
Until it's gone
Like it or not
You live on love
You try to do what's right
We're all here waiting for our silver invitation
To the big band in the sky,And when he closed his eyes
Fell into a dream that never dies
And when the thunder comes
You can hear his kick drum in the sky
Feel the rain
Fall from our eyes,Cause we don't know
What we got
Until it's gone
Like it or not
You live on love
You try to do what's right
For him there's no more waiting
Got his silver invitation
Just to do a little playing
For the big band in the sky"

And when I've lived out my days
Until the very end
I hope they find me in my home, a guitar in my hands
I hope they find me in my home with my guitar in my hands,A part of dawn to be ashamed of
But good people are supposed to be up
But I found peace with the path I took
As I lay down my head
Crossroads you gotta choose
Which way do we win or lose
But every bone in my soul says to sing on through,'Cause I believe that I
Was born with a song inside of me
Never question why

I bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
I was spending money like the way it likes to rain
Man I ended up with pockets full of cane,Oh my sweet Carolina

Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home,Never been to Vegas, but I gambled up my life
Though the newsprint boats are raced in sewer mains
Was trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what

Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home,And out here in the city seems like things are closing in
The sunset's just my light bulb burning out
I miss Kentucky and I miss my family
All the sweetest winds they blow across the South,Oh my sweet Carolina

Torn from his home.
Well, he was naked,
And destined
To be out on his own.
And he waited in darkness,
Hoping someone might see,
From something so rough,
What a treasure he'd be.,Stronger than steel and wood.
Seen me through the bad and good.
And when I'm hanging by a string,
Every little thing
Is understood
Between Martin and me.,Well he's hollow in the middle
From the shape that he's in.
He's either filled up with music
Or locked in his shell again.
And it takes some fine tuning
To make him come around,
But he's a huge piece of me
And I'll never put him down.,Stronger than steel and wood.
Seen me through the bad and good.
And when I'm hanging by a string,
Every little thing
Is understood
Between Martin and me.,He is a good friend,
And he has his own voice.
And you get what you give;
Sometimes it's just noise.
But if you treat him well
He will last your life long.
And if you're honest and open
Well, he will write you a song.
(Write you a song, write you a song),Stronger than steel and wood.
Seen me through the bad and good.
And when I'm hanging by a string,
Every little thing
Is understood
And when I'm hanging by a string,

Dans des cycles différents c'est marrant ces remous

Par les temps je cours à l'équilibre
Chaque jugement sur les gens me donne la direction à suivre
Sur ces choses en moi
A changer
Qui m'empêchent d'être libre
Les voix se libèrent et s'exposent dans les vitrines du monde en mouvement
Les corps qui dansent en osmose
Glissent, tremblent, se confondent
Et s'attirent irrésistiblement
Par les temps je cours à l'expression
Chaque émotion ressentie me donne envie d'exprimer les non-dits,Et que justice soit faite

Nos démons animés
Perdus dans nos dessins
Sans couleur, gris foncé,On aurait pu choisir le pardon
essayer une autre histoire d'avenir
Que de vouloir oublier,Prenons-nous la main

Choisissons nos destins

D'ouvrir grand nos petites mains

De se parler de nous
Nos fiertés tout devant
Sans pouvoir se mettre à genoux
Dans nos yeux transparents
Le mensonge sur nos dents
Impossible de le nier

Prenons-nous la main le long de la route
Essaye, vivre la vie, glisser sans retenir,Mais les mots ne sont que des mots
Pas les plus importants
On y met nos sens propres
Qui changent au gré des gens,C'est con, ce qu'on peut être con
A se cacher de soi-même
C'est con, ce qu'on peut être con
Car l'autre n'est que le reflet
de ce qu'on se met à couvert,Si nos schémas ancrés
veulent bien n'pas nous figer
C'est le début de nos rêves
Qui tendent à se confirmer,C'est con, ce qu'on peut être con
A se cacher de soi-même,C'est con, ce qu'on peut être con
Car l'autre n'est que le reflet de ce qu'on se met à couvert,C'est con, ce qu'on peut être con

J'aurais voulu devenir

Aucune bizarrerie,
Ça m'ennuie, ça m'ennuie.

De goûts pervers,Mais si, me dit le docteur
En se rhabillant,
Après ce premier essai,
C'est encourageant.
Si vous ne buvez pas,
Vous ne vous droguez pas
Et n'avez aucun complexe,
Vous avez une obsession:
C'est le sexe,Depuis je suis à la mode,
Je me rôde, je me rôde
Dans les lits de Saint-Germain,
C'est divin, c'est divin.
Je fais partie de l'élite,
Ça va vite, ça va vite
Et je me donne avec joie
Tout en faisant du yoga.
Je vois des films d'épouvante,
Je m'en vante, je m'en vante
En serrant très fort la main
Du voisin, du voisin.
Me sachant originale,
Je cavale, je cavale.
J'assume ma libido.
Je vais draguer en vélo.
Maintenant je suis parisienne.
Je me surmène, je me surmène
Et je connais la détresse
Et le cafard et le stress.
Enfin à l'écologie,
Je m'initie, je m'initie
Et loin de la pollution,
Je vais tondre mes moutons,Et loin de la pollution,
Je vais tondre mes moutons
Et loin de la pollution,
Je vais tondre mes moutons
Mes moutons
Mes moutons

Et les autres voient pas qui tu es,
trop sensible, je sais
Moi aussi ça a faillit me tuer,Avec ta petite gueule d'ange,
Tu nous fais voir des masques colorés,
Tous ces gens qui te croient innocent,
Mais toi tu voyages dans l'obscurité,
Avec ta petite gueule d'ange,
Tu laisses croire et ne semble qu'indiquer
Que dans ta tête y'a que des fleurs,
des sourires, des papillons
et du sucre vanillé.,Je ressens ta souffrance,
Je la vois, je l'écoute
Être en rage et déçu c'est normal
Mais ce n'est pas la seule route,
C'est à toi d'exprimer ta beauté,
D'éclairer de tes yeux,
Si autours de toi rien ne brille,
A toi d'être fort et d'y croire pour eux.,Dans ce monde qui fourmille de fantômes
On t'en fera des croches-pieds,
Cherche en toi cette lumière
Au coeur d'ange
L'humain est bien plus beau
que ce qu'il n'y paraît,
Ne laisse pas l'ignorance te duper,
Ne crois pas à leurs mensonges
Ils te donnent ce qu'ils peuvent,
ce qu'ils ont, existe en toi bien plus
que ce qu'on t'a inculqué!,T'es trop sensible, c'est vrai
Et les autres voient pas qui tu es,
Trop sensible, je sais
Moi aussi ça a faillit me tuer
T'es trop sensible, c'est vrai
Et les autres voient pas qui tu es,
Trop sensible, je sais
Moi aussi ça a faillit me tuer,T'es trop sensible, c'est vrai
Et les autres voient pas qui tu es,
Trop sensible, je sais
Moi aussi ça a faillit me tuer
T'es trop sensible, c'est vrai
Et les autres voient pas qui tu es,
Trop sensible, je sais
Moi aussi ça a faillit me tuer"

J'ai recollé tous les morceaux

Tous ces regards croisés, si les ai compris
J'ai pourtant vu mille fois, et suis encore surprise
De la beauté des êtres qui m'ont fait lâcher prise.,
C'est la beauté sans mot qui transforme un instant,
A genoux dans la glace, laissant faire ce qui doit,
Je garde en moi le chaud, la saveur du présent
De ces moments de grâce qui fut vous qui fut moi.,
Ils vivent leur ascension, grimpent et bravent leur peur,
Il n'y a nulle prison que celle qu'on ce crée au cœur,
Je prends note et leçon dans ses vives lueurs.
La lune, leurs regards, ne pas mourir avant l'heure.,Je garde précieusement l'expérience dans ma chair,
Revenir au quotidien lui non plus ordinaire,
Dans les pages d'un bouquin, ces phrases qui me décrivent,
Tout se termine et prend fin, après l'extase la lessive.,

Encordée dans ma tête jusqu'à mon sac-à-dos,
Des petites tempêtes me poussent vers le haut,
Le froid que je respire, je sens que je m'allège,
Je n'ai rien vu venir les deux pieds dans la neige.,Depuis c'est plus facile et un pas après l'autre,
Si je marche tranquille, si je suis quelqu'un d'autre,
J'aurai toute ma vie laissant faire ce qui doit,
Ce ce qu'on gravi qui fut vous qui fut moi.,

Dans le coeur d'un garcon
Sous le ciel de Paris
Marchent des amoureux
Hum Hum
Leur bonheur se construit
Sur un air fait pour eux,Sous le pont de Bercy
Un philosophe assis
Deux musiciens quelques badauds
Puis les gens par milliers
Sous le ciel de Paris
Jusqu'au soir vont chanter
Hum Hum
L'hymne d'un peuple épris
De sa vieille cite,Pres de Notre Dame
Parfois couve un drame
Oui mais a Paname
Tout peut s'arranger
Quelques rayons
Du ciel d'ete
L'accordon
D'un marinier
L'espoir fleurit
Au ciel de Paris,Sous le ciel de Paris
Coule un fleuve joyeux
Hum Hum
Il endort dans la nuit
Les clochards et les gueux
Sous le ciel de Paris
Les oiseaux du Bon Dieu
Hum Hum
Viennent du monde entier
Pour bavarder entre eux,Et le ciel de Paris
A son secret pour lui
Depuis vingt siecles il est épris
De notre Ile Saint Louis
Quand elle lui sourit
Il met son habit bleu
Hum Hum
Quand il pleut sur Paris
C'est qu'il est malheureux
Quand il est trop jaloux
De ses millions d'amants
Hum Hum
Il fait gronder sur eux
Son tonnerr' clatant
Mais le ciel de Paris
N'est pas longtemps cruel

Pour se fair' pardonner
Il offre un arc en ciel"

Tes vagabonds
Te font des scènes
Mais sous tes ponts
Coule la Seine
Pour la romance
A illusion
Y'a d'l'affluence

Dans les faubourgs
Prairie pavée
Où pouss'l'amour
Ça pousse encore
A la maison
On a eu tort
Mais c'est si bon
Regards perdus
Dans le ruisseau
Où va la rue
Comme un bateau
Ça tangue un peu
Dans l'entrepont
C'est laborieux
Mais c'est si bon,Paris je prends
Au coeur de pierre
Un compt' courant
Des bell's manières
Un coup d'chapeau
A l'occasion
il faut c'qui faut
Mais c'est si bon
Des sociétés
Très anonymes
Un député
Que l'on estime
Un p'tit mann'quin
En confection
C'est pas l'bais'-main
Mais c'est si bon,Pass'la monnaie
V'la du clinquant
Un coup d'rabais
And gentleman
Un carnet d'chèque
Sans provision

Un p'tit faubourg
Saint Honoré
Trois petits fours
Et je m'en vais
Surpris'party
Surpris'restons
On est surpris
Mais c'est si bon

À la mémoire de mes passages éclairs,De mes chambres d'hôtels trop chics, 
Des taxis jusqu'aux halls de gares, 
Des longs tunnels périphériques, 
Des avenues et des boulevards, ,Au bord des vertiges et des gratte-ciels, 
Des rendez vous, des bavardages, 
Dans les grandes villes, sans l'essentiel, 
Quand le béton me met en cage, ,De mes jours à côte de la plaque, 
Comme étrangère et sans repère, 
À me réfugier dans les parcs, 
Pour faire semblant de prendre l'air, ,J's 'rai toujours la môme des chemins,

Quand les bourgeons renaissent
Qu'une nouvelle jeunesse
S'empare de la vieille cité
Qui se met à rayonner
J'aime Paris au mois de mai
Quand l'hiver le délaisse
Que le soleil caresse
Ses vieux toits à peine éveillés,J'aime sentir sur les places
Dans les rues où je passe
Ce parfum de muguet que chasse
Le vent qui passe
Il me plaît à me promener
Par les rues qui s'faufilent
A travers toute la ville
J'aime, j'aime Paris au mois de mai,J'aime Paris au mois de mai
Lorsque le jour se lève
Les rues sortant du rêve
Après un sommeil très léger
Coquettes se refont une beauté
J'aime Paris au mois de mai
Quand soudain tout s'anime
Par un monde anonyme
Heureux de voir le soleil briller,J'aime quand le vent m'apporte
Des bruits de toutes sortes
Et les potins que l'on colporte
De porte en porte
Il me plaît à me promener
Dans les rues qui fourmillent
Tout en draguant les filles
J'aime, j'aime Paris au mois de mai,J'aime Paris au mois de mai
Avec ses bouquinistes
Et ses aquarellistes
Que le printemps a ramenés
Comme chaque année le long des quais
J'aime Paris au mois de mai
La Seine qui l'arrose
Et mille petites choses
Que je ne pourrais expliquer,J'aime quand la nuit sévère
Etend la paix sur terre
Et que la ville soudain s'éclaire
De millions de lumières
Il me plaît à me promener
Contemplant les vitrines
La nuit qui me fascine
J'aime, j'aime Paris au mois de mai"

And so I came to see him, and listen for a while
And there he was, this young boy, a stranger to my eyes,I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters, and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on,He sang as if he knew me, and all my dark despair

And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong

Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry,'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun,Rum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man down
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man down,Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station,It's a 22
I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm,I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town (yeah),'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun,Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man down
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man down,Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down (criminal)
In central station,And I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh, gosh
Whatever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Why did I pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger - boom
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon
When me pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull it 'pon you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do,Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Me say one man down (oh, what me say)
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum, rum, pum, pum, pum
When we went downtown,'Cause now I am a criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh, Lord, have mercy now I am a criminal
Man down
Tell the judge please gimme minimal
Run out of town none of them can see me now,Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station"

Grips on your legs
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
OT, OT is never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Baby I like your style
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time
And that's why I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need to know where do you wanna go
Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Cause if you're down
I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got the Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me"

Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you,At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me,
This is new to you
Initially,
I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you,,So, don't take advantage,
Don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it,So, won't you send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through,Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you,I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets
So, let's keep personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you,I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
I might make you mine by the night then,Send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Place to come through,Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you,Ride, ride, ride,
Come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
I don't need nothing else but you,Ride, ride, ride,
Come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you,I don't need nothing else but you"

Since ive been with you, Ooh
No it aint, No it aint noo
Its not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me
I know
Im gonna sip on this drink when im messed up
Should know how to pick em
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, and she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not, Why not, Why not, Why not, Why not
A good time never hurt nobody
Got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
Got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' - you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me boss
I got a hard head, but her heart soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million, told her plank on it
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm messed up
Should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, aye
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not, Why not, Why not, Why not, Why not
A good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
