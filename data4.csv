Raga ini menjagamu,Seperti alunan detak jantungku
Tak bertahan melawan waktu
Dan semua keindahan yang memudar
Atau cinta yang telah hilang,Tak ada yang abadi
Tak ada yang numaot
Tak ada yang abadi
Tak ada yang abadi,Ho, biarkan aku bernafas sejenak
Sebelum hilang,Tak 'kan selamanya
Tanganku mendekapmu
Tak 'kan selamanya,Raga ini menjagamu
Jiwa yang lama segera pergi
Bersiaplah para pengganti
Tak ada yang abadi
Tak ada yang abadi
Tak ada yang abadi
Tak ada yang abadi"

To ask me where I'd come
Was I alright?

May kwento kang pandrama na naman,Parang pang TV na walang katapusan
Hanggang kailan ka bang ganyan

Naiinis akong isipin na ginaganyan ka nya
Siguro ay hindi niya lang alam ang iyong

Napapagod na rin ako sa aking kakasalita
Hindi ka rin naman nakikinig
Kahit sobrang pagod na ang aking bibig,Sa mga payo kong di mo pinapansin
Akala mo'y nakikinig di rin naman tatanggapin
Ayoko nang isipin pa
Di ko alam ba't di mo makayanan na iwanan sya,Ang dami-dami naman diyang iba
Wag kang mangangambang baka wala ka nang ibang Makita
Na lalake na magmahal sayo
At hinding hindi nya sasayangin ang pag-ibig mo,Sa libu-libong pagkakataon na tayoy nagkasama

Sama-sama sa mga pasabog nila kiko at ni glock - astig patinikan ng bibig
Teka muna teka lang painom muna ng tubig
Shift sa segunda bago mapatumba
Dapat makaisip ka na rhyme na maganda
At madulas ang pagbigkas
At astig baka sakaling marinig
Ng libo libo na pilipino nakikinig sa mga pabibo ko
Di ka ba nagugulat sa mga naganap
Di ko din alam kung bat ako sikat
Para bang panaginip na pinilit makamit
Talagang sinusulit ang pagiging makulit
Kailangan galingan hindi na kayang tapatan ang tugtugan ng parokya at aming samahan
Shit! panu to wala nko masabi
Ngunit kailangan gumalaw ng mga labi kong ito
Kunyari nagbabakasakali
Na magaling din ako kaya nasali!,Natapos na si chito

Triggers in the maximum
Not a 45 or 44 magnum
And it aint even a 357
Nor 12 gauge but the mouth so listen
Nandito na si kiko at kasama ko si chito at si gloc 9
And its time to rock rhyme
Di ko mapigilan lumabas ang mga salita
Sa aking bibig di padadaig
Ang bunganga
Hala tumunganga
Lahat napapahanga sa talento
Akoy taga kalentong
Batang mandaluyong na ngayun nakatira sa antipolo
Sumasaklolo sa mga hiphop
Pwede karerin to'
Pwede rin trip lang,Si gloc kasama ng parokya
Parang bulagaan at kelangan di mabokya
Hindi mo na kelangang malaman
Kung bakit pa
Kaming lahat ay nagsamasama
Mic check eto na nagsanib na ang pwersa
Francis magalona-gloc9-at-ang-parokya
1 2 3 4 lets volt in!,Natapos na si chito
Si chito miranda
Tapos na rin si kiko
Si francis magalona
Nandito na si gloc 9,Gloc9: ahhh mic check - mic check,Wala syang apelyido,Gloc9: okay na ba ung mic?,Magbabagsakan dito
Kelangan ng magingat
At ang huling bagsakan
Si gloc 9 ang babanat!,Bato bato sa langit
Ang tamaan'y wag magalit
Bawal ang nakasimangot
Baka lalo ka pumangit
Pero okay lang
Hindi naman kami mga suplado
Sumabay ka sa amin na parang nkaeroplano
Sa tunog ng gitara
Kasama ng pinakamalupit na banda
Pati si kiko
Magaling-hindi parin kayang tapatan
Parang awit na lagi mong binabalik balikan
Stop-rewind and play mo
Nakapakasaya na para bang birthday ko
Alam mo na siguro ang ibig kong sabihin
Hindi na kelangan pang paikutikutin
Baka lalong matagalan lang
Lumapit at makinig na para iyong maintindihan
Mga salitang sinulat na hindi ko papel
Pero pwede ilatag
Na parang banig na higaan
Kapag hinawakan ang mikropono parang nabubuwang
Eh kasi naman siguro
Ganyan lang kapag gumagawa kami ng bago
Medyo nabibilisan
Hindi mo naisip na pwedeng mangyari
Magkasamasama lahat ay kasali!
Ge!,Chito miranda:
Ngayun lang nadinig
Hindi na to madadaig
Nagsamasama sa bagsakan
At naging isang bibig
Magingat ingat ka nga at baka masindak
Sapagkat andito na si chito-at-si-kiko-at-si-gloc!"

Kung ayaw mong masipa sa mukha ng malupet
Baka makatikim ka ng sasuwela de kamao
Na si listo el de gato sa gulpihang de kontodo,Vinci:
Talaga hindi nga tatawa na ba ako
Hindi porket koreano ka magaling kang mag-taekwando
Wag kang mag-aangas sa lalaking may balbas
Kami yung mga tipo na hindi umaatras,Dindin:
Sandali lang wag muna kayong maglaban
Bago kayo magsuntukan
Bat di nyo muna pag-usapan ang di maunawaan
Sige na kiss na, peace na please
Ang bayad mo sa jeepney kulang pa ng diyes
Kung ayaw mong mangyari ang nagyari sa iba
Matuto tayo kung paano magpakumbaba
Wag nating kalimutan kung saan nagsimula...,Band:
Alam naman nating lahat
Na mahal namin ang isa't-isa't
Walang iwanan sa parokya band
Sa parokya ni edgar,Band:
Band... Band...,Chito:
Ah di ko alam kung paano tatapusin yung kanta
Kaya ganito nalang bigla nalang mawawala"

Kung hindi mo susubukan...,Akala ko chicken yun pala asado
Akala ko bukas pero yun pala sarado
Akala ko mansanas yun pala banana
Akala ko meron pa, yun pala wala na,Akala ko foreign yun pala pinoy
Akala ko blackjack yun pala pusoy
Akala ko talo yun pala panalo
Akala ko si chito, yun pala ako
Akala ko dati walang mangyayari,Akala din nila ngayon wala silang masabi
Akala ng lahat mapapagod din ako
Mabuti nalang matigas ang aking ulo
Akala ko walang mapupuntahan kahit na paghirapan ngunit
Mali nanaman, kung hindi mo sinubukan sana'y hindi ko na nalaman,Eh di nasayang lang
Wag kang matakot na baka magkamali
Walang mapapala kung di ka magbakasakali
Dahil lumilipas ang oras
Baka ka maiwanan kung hindi mo susubukan
Wag kang matakot na baka magkamali
Walang mapapala kung di ka magbakasakali
Dahil lumilipas ang oras
Baka ka maiwanan kung hindi mo susubukan"

Ako'y kinabahan, dahan-dahang nilapitan...

Sa gitna ng dilim, kabado na naman ako!
Saking paligid, merong nakatitig...
OKATOKAT! Ako'y nanginginig!
So ako ay tumahimik at ako'y kinabahan.
Bumaba mula sa kama ko dahan-dahan...
sabay takbo sa ilaw at bigla kong binuksan,
salamin lang pala...buti na lang!
Masamang panaginip...OKATOKAT!
Asong makulit...OKATOKAT!
Titser kong nakakabuwisit...OKATOKAT!

And I hope that you would like

So I better choose my words cause I
Don't want it to be mushy...
Coz' that's the thing with lovesongs
And that's the tricky part

Singing from the heart,And when the car has comes, I must come up
With something clever
Cuz For you it's just a lovesong but for me
It's now or never!
And though I tried my best to make it
Beautiful and true
I Could Never Make A Song As
Beautiful As You...,And when the car has comes again, I must

Bilisan mo na
Gusto ko na magsunbathing

Makinig kay pareng bob

Lumalamig ang hangin

Masisira na ang ating ulo
Kailan ka ba naman huling tumambay

Parang tiwala pag naubos na!
Bigla biglaan talaga!
Mahirap nang makita
Kapag minsa'y nawala...,At kahit na pilitin, di mo
na mapapalitan
Kahit hanap-hanapin,
di mo na mababalikan
Kahit sabihin natin
na ika'y napagbigyan,
Wag na lang...,Ewan ko ba kung

Mahirap nang linisin pa,

When we've said goodbye
Remember me, once in a while
Please, promise me you'll try
And you'll find that once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me
We never said ""our love was evergreen""
Or ""as unchanging as the sea""
But if you can still remember,
Stop and think of me
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen
Don't think about the way
Things might have been
Think of me, think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me trying too hard
To put you from my mind
Recall those days, look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine? Bravo!
Long ago, it seemed so long ago
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me,
But I remember her
Flowers fade, the fruit of summer fade
They have their seasons, so do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me!

Why so silent, good Messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good Messieurs?
I have written you an opera.
Here, I bring the finished score.
Don Juan Triumphant!,Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting round the stage
Our Don Juan must lose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...,No doubt she'll do her best
It's true, her voice is good
She knows, though
Should she wish to excell
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me, her teacher
Her teacher...,PHANTOM
Your chains are still mine,
(spoken)
You belong to me!

Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night,Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before,Softly, deftly, music shall caress you

In this darkness that you know you cannot fight

Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me,Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write

Mystery after gala night
It says mystery of soprano's flight
Mystified all the papers say
We are mystified, we suspect foul play,Bad news on soprano's scene
First Carlotta now Christine
Still, at least, the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold,Diva tenders resignation
Cover does a moonlight flit,Half your cast disappears but the crowd still cheers
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hit!,(Andre interrupting)
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!,(Firmin)
Andre please don't shout!

Ah, it seems you've got one too,(Andre, reading)
Dear Andre what a charming gala,
Christine was, in a word, sublime
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left
On that note, the diva's a disaster, must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime!?!,(Firmin, reading)
Dear, Firmin
Just a brief reminder
My salary has not been paid
Send it care of the ghost by return of post
P.T.O
No one likes a debtor so it's better if my orders are obeyed!,(Both)
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain,(Firmin)
These are both signed O.G.,(Andre)
Who the hell is he?,(Both realizing)
Opera Ghost!,(Firmin)
It's nothing short of shocking
(Andre)
He is mocking our position!,(Firmin)
In addition he wants money!,(Andre)
What a funny apparition!,(Both)
To expect a large retainer
Nothing plainer, he is clearly quite insane!,(Raoul interrupting)

You mean Carlotta?,(Raoul)
I mean Miss Daae
Where is she?,(Andre)
Well how should we know?,(Raoul)

Isn't this the letter you wrote?,(Firmin)
And what is it that we're meant to have wrote? (realising his mistake)Written!,(Andre, reading)
Do not fear for Miss Daae
The angel of music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again.,(Raoul)

Here, I have a note,(Andre, Carlotta, Raoul)
Let me see it!,(Firmin, reaching for note)
Please,Gentlemen,
I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature
Detailing how my theatre is to be run
You have not...,(fading to the Phantom's voice),followed my instructions
I shall give you one last chance,(Phantom singing)
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the pageboy
And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent, which makes my casting, in a word, ideal,(Phantom talking)
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five
Which will be kept empty for me
Should these commands be ignored
A disaster beyond your imagination will occur
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant
O.G.,(Carlotta)
Christine!,(Andre)
Whatever next?,(Carlotta)
It's all a plot to help Christine!,(Firmin)
This is insane...,(Carlotta)
I know who sent this:
The Vicomte -- her lover!,(Raoul)

Sir.,Christine-
Raoul!,Phantom (to Raoul)-
This is indeed an unparalleled delight.
I had rather hoped that you would come.
And now my wish comes true.
You have truly made my night.,Raoul (pleading)-
Free her!
Do what you like only free her!
Have you no pity?,Phantom (to Christine, dryly)-
Your lover makes a passionate plea.,Christine
Please, Raoul, it's useless.,Raoul
I love her!
Does that mean nothing?
I love her.
Show some compassion.,Phantom ( snarls furiosly at Raoul)
The world showed no compassion to me!,Raoul
Christine, Christine, let me see her.,Phantom
Be my guest, sir.
Monsieur, I bid you welcome.
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay
For the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now!
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes!
Nothing can save you now
Except perhaps Christine.
Start a new life with me.
Buy his freedom with your love.
Refuse me and you send your lover
To his death!
This is the choice!
This is the point of no return!,Christine
The tears I might have shed
For your dark fate
Grow cold and turn to tears of Hate!,Raoul
Christine, forgive me.
Please, forgive me.
I did it all for you and all for nothing.,Christine
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend.
We had such hopes.,Phantom
Too late for turning back.,Christine
Now those hopes are shattered.,Phantom
Too late for prayers and useless pity.,Raoul
Say you love him,Phantom
All hope of cries for help.,Raoul
And my life is over,Phantom
No point in fighting.
For either way you choose you cannot win.,Raoul
But either way you choose he has to win.,Phantom
So do you end your days with me?
Or do you send him to his grave?,Raoul
Why make her lie to you to save me?,Christine
Angel of music.,Phantom
Past the point of no return.,Raoul
Christine, say no!,Christine
Who deserves this?,Raoul
Don't throw your life away for my sake.,Phantom
His life is now the prize,Christine
Why do you curse mercy?,Phantom
Which you must earn,,Raoul
I fought so hard to free you!,Phantom
You've past the point of no return!,Christine
Angel of music
You deceived me.
I gave you my mind blindly.,Phantom
You try my patience.
Make your choice.,Christine
Pitiful creature of darkness
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you,
You are not alone.,Mob
Track down this murderer.,Phantom
Take her! Forget me.
Forget all of this.
Leave me alone.
Forget all you've seen.
Go now!
Don't let them find you.
Take the boat. Leave me here, go now don't wait just take her and go before it's too late... Go... go now and leave me!,Mob
The phantom of the opera is there
Deep down below.,Phantom
(musical box plays magicaly)
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade.
Masquerade.
Hide your face
So the world will never find you.
(turns, finds Christine)
Christine, I love you,Christine
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime.,Raoul
Say the word and I will follow you,Christine
Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.,Phantom
You alone can make my song
Take flight.
It's over now, the music
Of the night!!! (Phantom sits on throne sits on part of his cloak, wraps the rest around him and disappears,Meg picks up his mask in her little hand)"

Dear Andre, what a splendid party
The prelude to a bright new year

What a pity that the Phantom can't be here,Masquerade! Paper faces on parade
Masquerade! Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade! Every face a different shade
Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you,Flash of mauve, splash of puce
Fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest
Trace of rouge, face of beast, faces,Take your turn, take a ride
On the merry-go-round in an inhuman race
Eye of blue, true is false
Who is who?,Curl of lip, swirl of gown
Ace of hearts, face of clown, faces
Drink it in, drink it up till you've drowned
In the light, in the sound but who can name the face?,Masquerade! Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you,Masquerade! Seething shadows breathing lies
Masquerade! You can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade! Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade! Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you,What a night! What a crowd!
Makes you glad
Makes you proud
All the crme, de la crme,Watching us, watching them
All our fears are in the past
Three months of relief
Of delight, of Elysian peace,And we can breathe at last
No more notes, no more ghost
Here's a health, here's a toast
To a prosperous year,To our friends who are here
And may the splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade,Think of it, a secret engagement
Look, your future bride, just think of it
But, why is it secret? What have we to hide?
You promised me, no, Raoul, please don't, they'll see
Well then let them see, it's an engagement, not a crime,Christine, what are you afraid of?
Let's not argue
(Let's not argue)
Please pretend

You will understand in time

What the future holds?
Why do fools fall in love?
What happens to our souls?,Clues to life's mysteries
Are what we hope to find!
Always reaching for a reason,
Searching for a sign!,To know the unknown! (It doesn't mean very much to me)
To know the unknown! (Some secrets are just meant to be)
Don't want all the answers, 'coz one thing is true!
As long as my heart beats, I'll always love you!,So I don't need to know the unknown!,Is there life on other planets?
Why's there magic in a kiss?
What dreams really mean?
Who hears us when we wish?,Everybody's wondering,
Trying to understand,
But all the revelations
Are castles in the sand!,To know the unknown! (It doesn't mean very much to me)
To know the unknown! (Some secrets are just meant to be)
I don't need all the answers, 'coz one thing is true!

Just why you went away!
Now that you've come back,
There's nothing more to say!,All I really need to know,

It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you, there's something else

A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night.
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life, you're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor,If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends
I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She just picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
""Aah, aah!"" is all I heard,I'm not gonna let de-elevator bring us down, oh no, let's go
Let's go crazy, let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck
Let's go,All excited, but don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause, we're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what's it all for)
Better live now
Before the grim reaper comes knocking on your door
Tell me baby,
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?

She said how'd you like to waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind,She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind,Nikki,The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind,Darlin' Nikki,Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you 4 a funky time

But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, Ooh, I saw her

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

I think I love her,Built like she was
She had the nerve 2 ask me
If I planned 2 do her any harm,So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm,I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed,She wasn't 2 bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how 2 get her kicks,She wore a

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

And the horses wonder who U are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
U feel like a movie star,Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance 2 do it all again,I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then,(Raspberry beret)

If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'd still see (U're beauty I'd still see)
Love's 2 weak 2 define - Just what U mean 2 me,From the first moment I saw U
Ooh, I knew U where the 1
That night I had 2 call U
I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' U just how fine U look
In a word, U were sex
All of my cool attitude U took
My body was next - U made love 2 me
Like U where afraid Was U afraid of me?
Was I the first? Was I your every fantasy?,That's why,Until the end of time I'll be there 4 U

Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know U are my fix
I know, that U know I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just 4 kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, ahh crucial baby
U could say that I'm a terminal case
(U could burn up my clothes)
Smash up my ride, (well maybe not the ride)
But I got 2 have your face
All up in the place
I'd like 2 think that I'm a man with exquisite taste
(I'm a man of exquisiteness)
A hundred percent Italian silk imported Egyptian lace
Nothin' baby, I said nothin' baby could compare
(Nothin could compare) 2 your lovely face (2 u're lovely face),Do U know what I'm sayin' 2 U this evening?
I'm tryin', tryin' 2 say
I'm just tryin' 2 say,That until, until the end of time

I'll be your eyes so U can see
I wanna show U things
That I show no other, I wanna be
More than, more than your mother
More than your brother

A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books 4 the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat 4 some clothes and a rep
With her chin up, she scolded ""All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step""
And step she did 2 the straight A's
Then college, a master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work 4 free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are triflin'?
They just don't know
She said ""Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'Girl, U need Pussy Control'"" (Are U ready?),Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh,Verse 2

Before she got dick in her drawers

In love Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick wanna stick her
Uh, talkin' more shit than a bit
'Bout how he gonna make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said ""Nigga, U crazy if U don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak

I need another piece of your ear
I wanna hip U all 2 the reason
I'm known as the Player of the Year
Cuz I met this girl named Pussy
At the club - International Balls
She was rollin' 4-deep
3 sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl drivin' a Hog
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said ""Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that U're here
I fear U're lonely and U want 2 know
A 12 o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that U're Pussy Control

But it's gonna be hard as hell
2 keep my mind off a body

Ladies, make'em act like they know
U are, was, and always will be Pussy Control (Are U ready?)
Peace and be wild (Aaah, Pussy Control),Say what, huh? (Oh)

I hope U had some baby, if not, boo hoo

Your honor, may I call 2 the stand my one and only witness?
A girl that know damn well she didn't have no damn business
I know what U did, how U did it and uh. who U did it with
So U might as well plead guilty cuz U sure can't plead the 5th
Now raise your right hand
Do U swear 2 tell the whole truth
Not the half truth like U used 2 so help U God?
Nod your head one time if U hear me

Yeah, U're gonna miss me
Uh, uh, uh, oh!

I'd like 2 have the defendant place her hands behind her back
So I can tie her up tight and get into the act
The act of showing her how good it used 2 be
I want it 2 be so good she falls back in love with me
Close your eyes
I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
And I want U 2 pump your hips like U used 2
And, baby, U better stay on the beat
Did U do 2 your other man the same things that U did 2 me?
Right now I hate U so much I wanna make love until U see
That it's killin' me, baby, 2 be without U
Cuz all I ever wanted 2 do was 2 be with U ... ow!

Call it, call my name,Heard your voice this morning, calling out my name,
It had been so long since I heard it, that it didn't really sound quite the same, no
But it let me know, that my name had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you through the bridal path door,,And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you,
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth,(Chorus)
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl,
I might go insane
I know it's only been about 3 hours
But I love it when you call my name,I heard a voice on the news saying people want to stop the war (stop the war)
If they had a love as sweet as you they'd forget what they were fighting for,
What's the matter with the world today?
The land of the free? Somebody lied
They can bug my phone and people 'round my home
They'll only see you and me making love inside,(Chorus),I've never seen the moon look so lovely as the night I saw it with you,
It let me know I'd never seen the moon before,
So many speak of the moon as though it had no flaws,
But to compare it to a beauty like yours would give one pause
Nothing about you is false, that's why your love is real
God forbid if you belonged to another I'd have to steal you
I'd have to take you from your man
I might be tempted to break the law round here
Because your beauty, it gives one pause
It slows me down,(Chorus)"

just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before,
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass u every day
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again,
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...,Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
and all good things, they say, never last,Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried,Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last,I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again,Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
But all good things, they say, never last,All good things they say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past"

Bouncin on the Summer Spring and when U start 2 Fall

She got them gold hot pants on again
Yeah man
I wanna talk, but I dunno
She's a peach,She was dark, she was tan
She made me glad to be a man
She was young, she was smart
Just one glance and she stole my heart
The kinda girl you wanna teach
She's a peach,Summertime, feelin' fine, getting wild
All that's on my mind
Here she come, dressed in red
Get her done is all that's in my head
Her hot pants can't hide her cheeks
She's a peach,She was pure, every ounce
I was sure, when her titties bounce
Every way, she's a winner
Turn a gay preacher to a sinner
No one you want your mama to meet
She's a peach,This is a girl plays hard to get,I would die if I kissed her
I would try but I'm last on her list
She's so cool and I'm so ugly
I'd be a fool to think that she could love me
This kinda girl's always out of reach
She's a peach"

Freedom agrees with us all, you see,In a state of mind that's weightless
See, on the quantum tip I flipped on the notion
When the Adam split, we got Eve
Duality's now a groupie with a backstage pass,And they ain't gonna leave till they get some
From grace we fall
Referring to the objects on the wall
I'd picture my hat, my coat, my balls,Around and round, around and round
(Round and round, round and round)
Huh, don't stop the pounds

I dunno, come on, Chelsea, I dunno, come on
Go ahead now, Chelsea, go ahead now
This for Jersey right here, go ahead now,Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
Kept her tears up in a bottle
She poured them out to save her soul,Ask her what she liked the most
She said she liked to talk to Jimi's ghost
Fantasy, a bragger's boast
Chelsea's fly like coast to coast,Hollywood or Times Square
If the party's fly, my girl is there
Earth boots on and flowers in her hair
21st Century hippie, Chelsea don't care,Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
She kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul,Try to catch her if you can
But you never see her with one man
'Cause they must be baptized according to the master plan
Before she give up the good thang, go 'head Chelsea,No blood diamonds or designer chic
'Cause she's too original from her head down to her feet
You can hate if you want to, Chelsea don't eat no meat
Still got butt like a letter C, go 'head Chelsea,Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
She kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul,Come on, Chelsea
Come on,Next to her, they just a fool
Chelsea read more books than a few
Like Moses was a Pharaoh in the 18th Dynasty
And Rome was chilling in Carthage in 33 BCE,And the day that we stop counting
We live as long as a tree
Go ahead Chelsea, teach me
Go ahead Chelsea,Make a promise to your higher self
Get true knowledge then fame and wealth
Then you don't be chasing nobody's ghost
Of everything make the most, come on,Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
She kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul,Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
Kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul,Come on Chelsea
Keep that body moving
Come on Chelsea
Make that body move,Come on Chelsea
Keep that body moving
Come on Chelsea
Make that body move,Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice,Chelsea Rodgers was a model
But she really rocked and rolled
Kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul,Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Poured them out to save her soul"

With his brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go,Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?

You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

And bring him to the ground,You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him

But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free!

On every lonely avenue

No one but you,One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you,Another tricky situation
I get the drownin' in the Blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well, what would you do?,Yes, it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through,One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
We'll remember
Forever,And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was in the way it was planned?,And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye
And it's one by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
Cryin' for nothing
Cryin' for no one
No one but you"

With a single sigh (please don't cry anymore)
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear,I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away,So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you
Anywhere you go
I'll be right behind you (oooh, oooh, oooh)
Right until the ends of the earth (ahhhhh)

would make him stay.,Since he was small,
had no luck at all,
nothing came easy to him.

to only pass the time
no more colouring books,no christmas bells to chime
but thinking young and growing older is no sin,and i can't play the game of life to win
i can recall a time
when i wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
and now i think i've got,a lot more than just my toys to lend
now there's more to do
than watch my sailboat glide
and every day can be,my magic carpet ride
and i can play hide and seek with my fears,and live my days instead of counting my years
then everyone debates
the true reality
i'd rather see the world
the way it used to be
a little bit of freedom's all we lack
so catch me if you can

Oh, I know that you love dancing so much
I know you love dancing.
Music's a wild thing with mischief to prove
I can't adjust to the way that you move
Music's a wild thing whatever the groove
Some music isn't for dancing
One dance whose steps I never could learn
It's called The Wedding March
The grace that it takes, the balance and poise,

Bakit nandiyan ka sa dulo?
Pwede bang kalimutan mong may dulo?

You ain't never, you ain't never lied
Just a little nigga representing from the 305
3 O, 3 O 5
Used to roll around up in that 1996 Nissan, 1996 Nissan
Bought it from an Arab
Got robbed 3 months later on some dumb shit
19, stunting on these niggas like I run shit
I was tryna get it
Every single morning took the bus and hit the studio
My nigga I was living on a mission
Thought I was the greatest
Every minute I would say I need a record deal
And nigga stayed wishing
Homie yelling all you do is rap rap rap
Seems like you don't even want to listen
Chill with it, you just got to deal with it
Can't stop a nigga when you know we got a vision
16s, all I got are 16s
Rap about it homie, you can get up on the big screen
Million dollar budgets in abundance
Know you got a chance if you keeping it 100
Oh man, oh man, oh man, so true
Couldn't be any more true
I just got to do what I do
Pray shit'll go according to the plans I choose
Everybody know what's best for the boy
All I get is suggestions
Pardon me but I ain't ask no questions
Got no time for the half ass lessons
Either bring it to the table or get to stepping
Lyrics on deck, I don't need no weapons
Still standing as a king, I don't see no peasants
24 freestyle, any rapping ass nigga
Only homage getting paid is to the OG legends,Feeling like I need it
All my life I know I need it, need it
It's the hunger, hunger
In this motherfucker
Hunger, hunger, in this motherfucker,What? Sue a nigga
Ain't been threatened by an album
Since I heard Food and Liquor
It's VMG till I D I E
Out of everybody ain't a question about who deliver
You DiGiorno ass niggas
Back when I was dead broke
Fuck I'm even talking bout, homie still dead broke
I ain't have a solid check in nearly over 2 years
Stable living was the resolution for the new years
Mama digging in her savings, tryna keep the lights on
Scared to borrow money from her, got to pay the iPhone
What the fuck am I on, guess I got to write songs
Rapping till the riches fill the pockets of my niggas
Let me paint a better picture
I'm Jigga with the double time
Nas on his esco, X on a couple lines
Common resurrected, Jadakiss up on his gumlines
Lloyd Banks 03, gunning with the punchlines
Fahrenheit Lupe, I am on a dedicated crusade
Long term, niggas only focus on the new wave
Next trend, jealous of their ex friends
Stunting out on Instagram, shit that y'all invest in
Nigga be yourself and get some self esteem with it
Ain't nobody gave me shit, bitch, fuck a hand out
Had to separate myself from everyone that stand out
Isolated from the ignorance, I had to camp out
In the studio, while other niggas threw them bands out
Getting stuck up on the daily, niggas bringing cans out
AK 47s, MAC 11s, get your hands out
Killing niggas over nothing, nothing ever pans out
God damn, RIP Mike V, trigga you my nigga
Hoping G's go to heaven, where the legends never die
Celebrate your legacy, homie I would never cry
Through these lyrics I be giving you
Become immortalized
Fuck with these haters, I cannot fuck with these haters
I cannot fuck with these haters
If I had a million would not spend a buck on these haters
Do not put my trust in these haters
I'm out for the crown, mission impossible
Love to kick you while you down
Just know when a prophecy comes to fruition
Ain't tryna hear shit from you clowns
Homie the hell is the matter
Chip on my shoulder got fatter
Fuck all that chitter and chatter
Like QuESt ain't a threat, homie please
You do not want to climb up that ladder
Fuck it, it don't even matter
My family need me
We hungry bitch, don't you be greedy
Can't none of these amateurs see me
Ain't shit automatic, I know it and still I get at it
I might just go macho man savage like (oh yeah)
Find me straight flexing on my Hunter Hearst shit
Feeling like the king of kings
Time to play the game, I am that damn good
Come and get this work bitch
Understand I'm more than just another wordsmith
Keep slaving every day, up on a daily workshift
I am legend in the making, verbal ventilation
Been the illest, I can prove it way more than I can say it
So sick of being patient, all of these rappers is basic
All of these rappers is basic, I find it amazing
This year I planned in advance, my condolences out to your favorites
I know that I got it, no arrogance, just being honest
Promise I'm just being honest
I waited and waited and waited when shit was the hardest
It's time to complete what I started, my nigga,Hunger, hunger, in this motherfucker"

When a Wallets down to the last 5 Bucks,
Skip the Bus, Skip the Train,
Keep on walking home to some back beat music,,When you are down and out, With no hope at all!
When the whole worlds seems to be falling apart!!,Chorus: Close your eyes & just relax spread your arms & Fly to Wonderland,
If the worst is yet to come, miracles do happen in Wonderland,2nd Verse: If you dont get paid today,
Pray to God tomorrow will be a better day,
If you aint got no money for a meal,
Try and settle for a Dollar menu meal,,When you are down and out, With no hope at all!

As you all know, Jermaine Dupri so so debt
Posted Survival of The Freshest Rap Battle
Tour to end last year
Now we wanna thank everybody for comin' out
Er'body for showin' they support
Here's the deal
I watched videos from all the contestants
And I've chosen one who I think is the best
It's the homeboy QuESt from Miami
So QuESt, you on yo way to Atlanta
Southside studios and get a track by me for your
Demo deal!
And all I hear is
'QuESt you got the talent, so tell me why you aint blow, nigga?'
Dont even know nigga, matta fact, I know
I just hate to admit that I made mistakes in my past
I wish I had the chance to erase
Industry be treated like a relay and every night I replay
Situations where it could have been on, nigga
Masonry is still fucking with my dome, nigga
Whats even worse is that my 11 Gs they gave me
To compensate for the loss, I blew in less than seven months, nigga
Imagine coming back to what happened with JD
After bragging to everyone, like niggas bout to pay me
Nineteen, thinking like this is the shit I work for
I cried myself to sleep for three days straight, no homo
Fuck it! Back to these rhymes, no wasting time on the could have been
Or shoulda been, just spit my struggles till Im maxed out
I black out, five tapes dropped in less than a year or 2
A buzz I felt would place me amongst the hottest
But nah, nigga! Sit ya black ass down!
You in the same situation with your black ass now
One of your projects could have got you the shine that you revered
But you dropped it, and like an idiot just fucking disappeared
I was young and stupid, plus no type of assist or direction
A proper representation, no plan to keep me a method
Shit it, Im hard headed
Would think that I would learn, but did it again twice
Like it was nothing of my concern
Struggle rapper, what are ya after!?
Ever since 7even I looked to heaven, dont let it happen!
My barber gave me free cuts, told me if you aint rappin', forget it
Im fuckin' taxing, no asking
Thats why my passion has never been lacking
Im looking for some answers!
When niggas that you started with seem to master the art of it
And climb beyond the stances
Reminiscing when Kendrick was prepping on dropping OD
When Cole released the warm up, but on my mama I had cold feet
Fast forward a couple years later, you see the time pass
Like what progression have I made, excuses made
At some point my jealousy ragin'
When I should be lookin' inside
But I dont want to face it, save it!
Plus Im dealing with life shit
Like how the fuck Im finna pay my life shit
Support a 9 to 5 or full time just rhyme shit
Choking on this music while it has me in a Heimlich
The same that saved me can destroy me, what a science
You dont get me up, but twenty two and in my mommas house
Barely graduated, fuck is college when the dramas out
Fired from my recent job and filed for unemployment
Pay a bill to silence scrutiny and bring about enjoyment
This music is only real if you can somehow pay the bills
And I aint eatin' wortha' shit, but in time I know I will
You can tell that to the woman who brought your life in this world
Supporting you while you chasing dream and sex with your girl
In your little brothers room while hes sleepin' out on the couch
I feel embarrassed to even let it come from out of my mouth, damn! (shit's real)
And thats just only half of the story
Ill take you back to '07, shit is true
When I was kicked out, spent my last 20$ on a cool
In the course of 5 years, I returned to where I left from
Acquired the desire, and lost it faster than redrum
Dont even fret a piss when I hear these rapper you dis'
Like they got it!
And Im the one that was slept upon and just missed
I dismiss that
Peace to the niggas getting their kit kat
No love and showing hate, thats how a bitch act
I swear Ill never get that
But wont even lie I wish that it was me
Half of these niggas take for granted what they see
Thats why when niggas get multiple chances to do it right
And fail to follow up, it makes me sick to my knees
Struggle rapper, what are you after
This could be beautiful, or turn into a great disaster
Truly my calling, I just hope I didnt miss it
If I did, god tell me or just leave a lil message
Im stressin' on a certain when certainty lies at fate
And my faith must lie on yo labor
Forgive me now for sinning, but ache assist the behavior
Sometimes I get the holy ghost like Jesus is my savior
Turn around and doubt the path you lay for me to walk your favor
A human with a dream of rhyming
Music is changing so much I barely notice the climate
Maybe my image needs improvement
Maybe Im doing too much on my own
And need to drop some of this weight on my team for me to get known
Im my own label, my own publicist, my own composer
My own engineer, a lone soldier
I got to keep me motivated
Everybody I know has made it
Struggling the most in a circle full of personal favors
You know I spit it from the heart nigga
Its been like its from the start nigga
The only thing that I was taught nigga
Honesty the policy and choice, so know your part nigga
For real, you joke about it but I wake up having nightmares
Lack of recognition, thirty plus, recitin' white tears
Im torn, meanin' my thoughtsll never give me my shot of where I want to be
Looking at my peers and feeling low within economy
Pissed off, gazing in the mirror, hardly sleeping
Missed opportunities haunting me
Fighting from resentment, my wife is strugglin' to call me
Breaking the T.V. when the Grammy's show and Im not part of it
Thats why I got to hustle
The nightmares feel as real as the dreams, stand clean with a lot of muscle
Even the thought of becoming worthless is motivation
So fuck you to whoever thought in they soul hating
Struggle rapper, just dont become a struggle rapper
Whatever you after, dont waste your time and become a laughter
The fans turn into a blind motivation
But I still understand, it takes time, no patience
Though, this is everything I saw
Nothing else besides me and these motherfucking flows
I need this one chance, and I promise I will show
Everyone who seem to tell me what I already know
What are you after?
What will you sacrifice?
No matter what you choose
Don't let em see you die"

To make me happy when you are away
As your Love comes from far and far away,Lets go out and find a place
To Rock all night and dance away

Shake it up on the floor tip toe
As you hold me tight, as we dance through the night

But you're making it so hard
And I guess it's safe to say
You take my pain away,And I just want to hold you all night long
Whenever I'm around you nothing's wrong
I'm hoping that you'll always be around
You got me on a high, I don't want to come down,And I love it, I love it

Yeah, I love it, I love it

Everything is different
You always know just how to make me laugh
You got me all up in my feelings
And as much as I love the feeling
I hate it, it gets me frustrated
When I say just how I feel but don't know how you would take it
Why do you do what you do to me?
Got me doing things that I don't do usually,I promised myself I wouldn't fall
But every time I see you I just want to risk it all
And baby yeah I know it ain't right
But the chemistry we have is so hard to fight,I just want to hold you all night long

If you tell me yeah, boy I might just risk it all
If you tell me no, it's okay then I will leave (ooohhh)

I held you down for the longest
And I was there through all of your darkest moments
Feels just like yesterday when we were homeless
Got you some bread and started treating me bogus
Talking 'bout you wanted something new
Like I wasn't good enough for you
Guess you done caught you a case of amnesia
Maybe you should take a look in your rearview
'Cause obviously you forgot all the times I held you when you cried
And don't you remember that even if you was in the wrong
I still stayed by your side
No I guess not, I guess not
'Cause you let them thots take my spot
Congratulations to you, what you wanted is what you got now,[Chorus]
So you don't gotta worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy (yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around, comes around
You don't gotta worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy (yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around, comes around,[Verse 2]
I remember when you said that you could have somebody better
And I can't even lie to you it really messed my head up
Had me lookin' in the mirror disgusted with myself
Wishin' that I looked like someone else
Like the girls you liked on Instagram (damn)
And you really had the nerve to call me insecure
Maybe it wasn't you
Maybe it's true I didn't know my worth
Maybe, maybe I should've loved me first,[Chorus]
So you don't gotta worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy (yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around, comes around
You don't gotta worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy (yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around, comes around,[Outro]

just a friend, just a friend.,ok,My intuition never lies
there's nothing you can ever hide
already got the screenshots
so there is no need to deny,you been creeping and freaking and sneaking like you'll never lose me
steadily claiming that everyone know we together but you steady choosing,swear I can not win for losing
i've been out here being faithful
I always got this on lockdown
but that aint been keeping us stable,so i guess i know what i got to do
give you a taste your own medicine
hey yeah,how would you like it if I do the things you do?
put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
i'mma ride 'em crazy, and you'll never have a clue
give another guy every thing that belongs to you,i'mma call up Bryan, i'mma face-time Ryan, i'mma text Lorenzo, and i'mma leave you crying,don't get it twisted, I can play this game too
how would you like it if I did the same to you, same to you
yeah,you don't like it
now you telling me that i should fight it
why you be out here playing the victim
when I am the one who be crying,why dish out it, but can't take it?
I want revenge, I can't fake it
want to see the look on your face when i drop my clothes and I get naked,not for you (ooh)
but for him (him)
now tell me playa
how does it make you feel?,how could you play me when the love I gave was real?
I even took you back, and you still had no chill,boy you ain't gon never learn
play with fire, you get burned
I don't think you understand
til I hit you where it hurts
yeah,so I guess I know what I got to do

Check your soul at the door

Fast talkin' it promises
Never really reaching the lines,Seems to bizarre
Such a twisted reality
This place full of manic minds,It's like a dreamland
With time standing still
So make your big plans

While the dirty works the girl's booty
Whispered in my ear what I want to hear
Says, ""Come with me baby, let's play."" (Okay!),She went to the back to get her traps
My sixth sense was bothering me
She came to work and something I heard
Makes me want to get comfy,Down and dirty
She's down and dirty, alright
Get down and dirty
Get down (Listen)
Down and dirty,Woo!
Alright
Ooh yeah,Well there's something going on
Something I've never known before
Leather and lace is all that I can see
I lost my power of will
You know she should be still
Never thought I'd get hit by some teen, no,I start to bleed, have mercy on me
I'm feelin' a bit distressed
What you're doing to me is so obscene
Got myself into a mess,She started to dance, I grabbed my pants
Found my way to the door
Hot on my trail, a thousand females
Saying, ""Baby, more more more!"",Down and dirty
(Hurt me)
Down and dirty
(Well, well, well)
Down and dirty
(Oh yeah)
Get down and dirty

Get dirty (Dirty)

Get dirty (Turn around)
Get down (Come over here)

You gotta do what you must
Practice what you preach
If you got an invitation
We'll change the location

Whole lotta love, tons!
Give me love

Strike it rich what you're dreamin' of

Let's pump her, pump her

We're gonna hunt for gold
Gonna dig for love,The more I get
The more I want
Love mushes out my brain
She's gotta move real slow
High and low
The girl's gonna drive me insane
She's got a real cool cat
That know where it's at
Has to be the ultimate find

Description: A spitting image of me,

Pinned like a note in a hospital gown.
Prison of sleep.
Deeper down the rabbit hole never to be found - again.,Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone.
Feelings, raw and exposed
when I'm out of control.,Pieces were stolen from me,
or dare I say, given away.
Watching the water give in as I go down the drain.
I appear missing now.,I go missing - no longer exist.
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss.,Shock me awake, tear me apart.
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown.
Deeper I sleep.
Further down the rabbit hole never to be found.
It's only falling in love because you hit the ground.,Dancing on wire, both ends are on fire.
Cut me loose.
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend.
Wandering along the road in the summer night.,I go missing, no longer exist.
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss.,Shock me awake, tear me apart.
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown.
Deeper I sleep.
Further down the rabbit hole never to be found.,(Confide.)
With my toes on the edge it's such a lovely view.
(Don't cry.)
I never loved anything until I loved you.
(Inside.)
I'm over the edge, what can I do?

Broken reflection outta luck
Nobody ever needed it,I got what was

Canary in a gilded cage
Singing,Sweet soft and low
I will poison you all
Come closer racing to your tongue,I got what was
I want to take what's left
No talk will cure, what's lost or save
What's left, for the deaf,The blind can go get fucked
Lie beside the ditch
This halo round my neck
Has torn out every stitch,Who are you hidin'?
Is it safe for the deaf?
Beautiful, cancer
infiltrate, and forget,Then I saw you comin'
Then I heard not a thing
A mistake not to listen
When I knew where you'd been?,I got what was

Fine with either
Gave birth to monsters who will terrorize normalcy, yeah

Rolled 'em down and she noticed it
How many times have I told you
To roll up the weed and don't smoke the shit?
How many times have I told you
To stay down and someone gon' notice it
How many times have I told you
Don't knock the police but I told you to
How many times have I told you

Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurting,Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through,If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I'm sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...,Work, work, work, work, work, work

Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry,'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him

If you're playin' me for a fool, I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company,He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again,And to him I just can't be true,And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful and it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy,I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore,I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life,I don't wanna be...
A murderer
I feel it in the air,As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell,Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful and it kills him inside,To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why,Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside,I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...

I might as well take a gun and put it to his head, get it over with,I don't wanna do this

Whoa, oh oh

I don't wanna be the reason why

But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refuse counsellin'
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you I'm out it,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie,I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king,Guitar##,Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused when I asked you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king,Guitar##,My California King,In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on the stars
For your heart for me

Everybody right here, what you need to do is to be thankful for the life you got
You know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em, baby girl, hey,You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are (Rihanna, let's get it),So live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters,Just live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya,Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
(Joss, we did it again homie)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Nevermind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away,Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day,Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day,It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray,I'm West Side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away,Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make them put the K's away,Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You rather see me catch a case, then watch my future fade away.
You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars,And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are
So live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay,You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay,Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay,'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (Ay), my life (Oh), my life (Ay), my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay), my life (Oh), my life (Ay), my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life,I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagga of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate but still'd grab a nigga by the collar quick,Whoever havin' problems with they record sales, just holla T.I.P.,If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow T.I.P.,I got love for the game, but ay, I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comical
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
""Where you from, who you know, what you makin', what kind of car you in?"",Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into ya bank account, and you've up out of poverty
Your values is in disarrayed, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss-poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?
You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars,And then you see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows who you are
So live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay
No telling where it'll take ya
Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (Ay), my life (Oh), my life (Ay), my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay), my life (Oh), my life (Ay), my life (Oh)
Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin,' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money, and I'm not goin' nowhere
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
And look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'
'Til the game end, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, my life
In a brand new city, got my whole town wit' me
The life, my life, I do what I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life, and I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life, and I'm not stopping
So live your life"

everything is restless in my heart
i hate the way this feels
suddenly i'm scared to be apart
the days are dark when you're not around
the air is getting hard to breathe
i wish that you would just put me down
i wish that i could go to sleep,loving you is suicide
i don't know should go or should i stay
i'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late
but i heard you say you loved me
that's the part i can't forget
and i wish that you come save me
cos i'm standing over the edge,i should let you go
tell myself the things i need to hear
but my brain is wired wrong
that's why i'm loving you when you're not here
feels like i drown in your every word
and every breath that's in between
somehow you got me where it really hurts
it's killing every part of me,loving you is suicide
i don't know should go or should i stay
i'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late
but i heard you say you loved me
that's the part i can't forget
and i wish that you come save me
boy cos i'm standing over the edge,loving you is suicide
and my world's about to break
and i... had as much as i can take
and love is a long way down,loving you is suicide
and it's getting harder everyday
i'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late
and i'm way past every moment
but i'm still determined to fight
and i know it's taking all my strength
to keep these emotions alive
loving you is suicide"

I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
Should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it

It's like I checked into rehab
And baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
And baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab

But the hottest bitch in heels right here (here)
No fear (feat) and while you're getting your cry on

Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now
Run through your town I shut it down (down)
Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that, yeah

So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard,Go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me -- go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""give me back my swag!"" -- they trying to clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, ""Louis Man""?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be,Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at? Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at? Where your lighters at?

But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie,I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie,You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
Now you're in each others face,
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance,
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave,
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie,Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Such pretty sight,Adrenaline keeps me in the game
Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain
Wilder than your wildest dreams
When you're going to extremes
It takes adrenaline
(You don't feel the pain),Sail through an empty night
It's only you and I who understand
There is no plan,Get closer to the thrill
Only time will kill
What's in your eyes
Is so alive,Adrenaline keeps me in the game
Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain
Wilder than your wildest dreams
When you're going to extremes
It takes adrenaline,Run through the speed of sound
Every thing slows you down
And all color that surrounds you
Are bleeding to the walls
All the things you really need
Just wait to find the speed
Then you will achieve
Escape velocity,Too much is not enough
Nobody gave it up
Im not the kind
To lay down and die,Adrenaline
keeps me in the game

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company,He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again,And to him I just can't be true,And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful and it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy,I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore,I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life,I don't wanna be...
A murderer
I feel it in the air,As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell,Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful and it kills him inside,To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why,Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside,I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head, get it over with,I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Whoa, oh oh
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore

I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye,Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole 'in love' thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing,My mind is gone, I'm spinnin' 'round
And deep inside my tears I'll drown
I'm losin' grip, what's happenin'?
I strayed from love, this is how I feel,This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms

'Cause it's hurtin' me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I shoulda never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give it to you on purpose
Gotta figure out how you stole my heart,My mind is gone, I'm spinnin' 'round

You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused when I asked you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

But I'm ready to dead this

And the letters she sent

You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish

It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out,We Ride, when we ride we ride

I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(when we ride we ride, it's 'til the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say

Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it even though Katie
Told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, hmm
Don't understand it but on your hands
Just knew that you're sister repeated you're trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh,This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
I still love you but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid,My new nickname is ""you idiot"" (such an idiot), hmm
That's what my friends are calling me when they see me and ringing to my phone
They're telling me let go
He is not the one
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it
Like you want it, screaming and cheating
Oh, girl why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
You telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But oh, ya sis repeated you're trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why,This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
I still love you but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid,Tryna' make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holdin' on
But the dumb's cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you wore all your lies
Till I'm gone, gone, gone...
But I was the one, which one of us is really gone,No, no, no-o, I'm not stupid in,(Love) This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
I still love you but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid,I may be dumb but I'm not stupid in love"

There may have been one teeny tiny spark
You're not calling Mark,How do you stay on your feet

It's 'trick or treat'
(And tonight it's 'trick')

I don't believe those two after everything I've done
Ever since our wedding I'm dirt -- They'll see

Forces are gathering
Can't turn away
Forces are gathering,Ughhhhh--

Maureen?
Okay, all right, I'll go!,How do you leave the past behind
When it keeps finding ways to get to your heart
It reaches way down deep and tears you inside out
Till you're torn apart
Rent!,How can you connect in an age
Where strangers, landlords, lovers
Your own blood cells betray,What binds the fabric together
When the raging, shifting winds of change
Keep ripping away,Draw a line in the sand
And then make a stand,Use your camera to spar,Use your guitar,When they act tough - you call their bluff,We're not gonna pay,We're not gonna pay,We're not gonna pay,Last year's rent
This year's rent
Next year's rent
Rent rent rent rent rent
We're not gonna pay rent,'Cause everything is rent"

And although he once had principles
He abandoned them to live as a lapdog to a wealthy daughter of the revolution,""uh one two three that's bull"" he said
Ever since that cat took up the fiddle that cows been- jumping
The dish and the spoon were evicted from the table and eloped
She's had trouble with the milk and the moon ever since
Maybe its a... female thing,'Cause who'd want to leave Cyberland anyway?
Walls ain't so bad
The dish and the spoon for instance, they're down on their luck
THey come knocking on my doghouse door and i say,
""NOT IN MY BACKYARD, UTENSILS, GO BACK TO CHINA!"",The only way out is up

Sill thirsty... parched, have some milk
And I lowered myself beneath her and held my mouth to her swollen udder
And sucked the sweetest milk I have ever tasted (slurp)
""CLIMB ONBOARD!"" she said,And as a harvest moon rose over Cyberland, we reared back
And sprang into a gallop

'Cause Santa Claus ain't coming
No room at the Holiday Inn again

Which he's cut together,To screen tonight
In honor of Benny's wife

Pulling Benny out of the east village location,Then again, maybe we won't screen it tonight
I wonder how Alison found out about Mimi?
Maybe a bird told her or an angel
I had a little hunch you could use, a little 'flow,Tutoring again? Negative
Back at you? No, no you, no
I rewired the ATM at the food emporium
To provide an honorarium to anyone with the code,The code, well

The powers that be must be undermined
Where they dwell in a small exclusive

With a private corner banquette in the back
We'll make it yet, we'll somehow get to Santa Fe,But you'd miss New York before you could unpack

Maureen?
It's Mimi, I can't get her up the stairs,No, she was huddled in the park in the dark
And she was freezing and begged to come here
Over here, oh, god
Got a light, I know you, you're shivering,She's been living on the street
We need some heat
I'm shivering
We can buy some wood and something to eat,I'm afraid she needs more than heat
I heard that
Collins will call for a doctor, honey
Don't waste your money on mimi, me, me,Hello-911? I'm on hold
Cold, cold, would you light my candle
Yes, we'll, oh God, find a candle,I should tell you
I should tell you

Shh, I know
I should tell you why I left
It wasn't, 'cause I didn't,I know, I should tell you

Wanna be the cause of a fight
Wanna put on a tight skirt and flirt
With a stranger""

Looking for romance?
Come back another day
Another day,MIMI,The heart may freeze or it can burn
The pain will ease if I can learn,There is no future
There is no past

Don't think all day
Dive into work
Drive the other way
That drip of hurt
That pint of shame
Goes away
Just play the game
You're living in America
At the end of the millennium
You're living in America
Leave your conscience at the tone
And when you're living in America
At the end of the millennium
You're what you own,ROGER,How'd I let you slip away
When I'm longing so to hold you
Now I'd die for one more day
'Cause there's something I should have told you
Yes there's something I should have told you
When I looked into your eyes
Why does distance make us wise?
You were the song all along
And before this song dies,COLLINS,I've longed to discover
Something as true

Was born in a zoo,
He lived there too.,For two years and a half,
He hasn't had a bath,
My mommy doesn't lick me,
Even when I'm sticky.,From candy floss, candy apples, popcorn,
Soft drinks jellybeans and gumdrops.,There must be something better,
Then living in this cage,
But I'm really not too sure,
Cause I'm rather short of age.,Joshua giraffe,
Was feeling kind of sad,
Things were going bad.,How little of life he'd had,
Wasting away with no room to play,
Trapped in a zoo with buffalo poo.,So he went next door to the elephant,
And asked him what to do.,I'm wasting away with no room to play,
I'm trapped in a zoo with buffalo poo.,The elephant was very old and gray,
And he had a huge balloon bottom.,And he said,
""Never fear Joshua, for a vision will appear"".,And that night, a dream came to Joshua,
And Joshua saw animals like crazy monkeys,
And a whole pile of Hippypotostropasuses,
And flitty moths, moths size 12
And sleazy lizards,
And a tribe of nasty saviars.,But Joshua wasn't afraid
Because he sang himself this song:,Nothing can go wrong-o,
I'm in the Kongo,
Nothing can go wrong-o,
I'm in the Kongo,
Nothing can go wrong-o,
I'm in the Kongo,
Nothing can go wrong-o,
I'm in the Kongo,
Nothing can go wrong-o,
I'm in the Kongo,
Nothing can go wrong-o,
I'm in the Kongo.,Even in his dream he knew,
He'd never get away,
Not even for a day.,Then a peanut hit him on the nose.,Joshua Giraffe was back in the zoo,
What could he do,
Awakened from his dream,
He'd never be the same,
Because of what he'd seen.,He'd seen:
Alligators, crocodiles, tree sloth
Anacondas, cobras and,
Large winged moths,
Orangatangs, baboons eating grapes,
Gibbons, rude mandrills and just plain apes.,But Joshua was lucky,
He had some special friends,
And that day they went to the zoo,
But he was up tight so they waited till the night,
And they chopped his cage in two,
He discovered he could fly and,
He soared into the sky with them,
Wrapped around his neck,
And they haven't come back yet,
So if you see them get a net.,That's right, they haven't come back yet.
But when they do, they say they are
Going to free all the animals from their cages,
No matter how new or modern,
Even some pets, too.
So if on your way home today,
You happen to find...,A baboon basking in the balcony,
Or a lion licking a lemon in the lobby,
Or a python perched in the pantry,
A wildebeest in the W.C.,
With a turtle twirling in your tub,
Don't be afraid, just say your a friend,
Of their friend.,Joshua Giraffe, Joshua, Joshua
Joshua Giraffe, Joshua, Joshua

Care and provide for every child
Each and every household could sing a song of joy
All round this planet, a new light within it could
And the children sing: help our light to shine
May we all be fed, may we all be loved.
May the elders here open up their hearts
To this song of ours, may they do their part.
may our dreams unfold, may we find our place
In a healthy world, embracing every race
May we all be free, may we live in peace-
Hear the children sing, hear us sing
Turn turn turn, Turn this world around

Like we were so high
But love was all that we were on
We belong,And though the world would
Never understand

And why it still stands
Someday we will be set free.
Pray and believe,When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream,I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here
Save your eyes,From your tears
When everything's unclear
You'll be safe here,From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Wounded heart,When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here
In my arms
Through the long cold night
Sleep tight
You'll be safe here
When no one understands
I'll believe
You'll be safe
You'll be safe
You'll be safe here
Put your heart in my hands
You'll be safe here"

Kahit ano pa yan
Minsan lang natatabunan ng saya
Sama-sama tayo, halina't kumanta,(Repeat Chorus),[Bridge]
Minsan tayo ay nadadapa
Kontra sa ihip ng tadhana (Ayos lang yan)
Wag ka munang mag-alala (Ayos lang yan)
Magkamali man, sagot kita (Ayos lang yan)
Bukas ang pintuan ng barkada
Dito ka nalang muna,Sumigaw, tumingin
Kung saan ka nanggaling
Harapin ang hamon ng buong mundo (Handa ka na ba? )
Asahan mo na hanggang sa huli
Nandito lang kami
Nandito lang kami"

She waltzes on her way to Mass and whistles on the stair
And underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair
I even heard her singing in the abbey,She's always late for chapel, but her penitence is real
She's always late for everything, except for every meal
I hate to have to say it, but I very firmly feel Maria's not an asset to the abbey,I'd like to say a word in her behalf
Maria makes me laugh,How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find the word that means Maria?
A flibbertijibbet! A will-o'-the wisp! A clown!,Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?,Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?,When I'm with her I'm confused, out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather, she's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!,She'd out pester any pest, drive a hornet from its nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle! She is wild! She's a riddle! She's a child!
She's a headache! She's an angel! She's a girl!,How do you solve a problem like Maria?

Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Te
Oh let's see if I can make it easier
Do- A deer, a female deer
Re- A drop of golden sun
Mi- A name I call myself
Fa- A long, long way to run
So- A needle pulling thread

What will my future be? I wonder.
It could be so exciting to be out in the world, to be free
My heart should be wildly rejoicing
Oh, what's the matter with me?,I've always longed for adventure
To do the things I've never dared
Now here I'm facing adventure
Then why am I so scared?,A captain with seven children
What's so fearsome about that?,Oh, I must stop these doubts, all these worries
If I don't I just know I'll turn back
I must dream of the things I am seeking
I am seeking the courage I lack,The courage to serve them with reliance
Face my mistakes without defiance
Show them I'm worthy
And while I show them
I'll show me,So, let them bring on all their problems
I'll do better than my best
I have confidence they'll put me to the test
But I'll make them see I have confidence in me,Somehow I will impress them
I will be firm but kind
And all those children (Heaven bless them!)
They will look up to me,And mind me with each step I am more certain
Everything will turn out fine
I have confidence the world can all be mine
They'll have to agree I have confidence in me,I have confidence in sunshine
I have confidence in rain
I have confidence that spring will come again
Besides which you see I have confidence in me,Strength doesn't lie in numbers
Strength doesn't lie in wealth
Strength lies in nights of peaceful slumbers
When you wake up -- Wake Up!,It's healthy - all I trust I lead my heart to
All I trust becomes my own
I have confidence in confidence alone
(Oh help!),I have confidence in confidence alone
Besides which you see I have confidence in me!"

She waltzes on her way to Mass and whistles on the stair.
And underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair.

She's always late for everything, except for every meal.
I hate to have to say it, but I very firmly feel.
Maria's not an asset to the abbey.,I'd like to say a word in her behalf.
Maria makes me... laugh.,How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find a word that means Maria?
A flibbertijibbet! A will-o'-the-wisp! A clown!,Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her.
Many a thing she ought to understand.
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?,Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?,When I'm with her I'm confused, out of focused and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am.
Unpredictable as weather, she's as flighty as a feather.
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!,She'd out pester any pest, drive a honet from its nest.
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl.
She is gentle, she is wild.
She's a riddle, she's a child.
She's a headache! She's an angel! She's a girl!,How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?

We do not flee from a mortgagee
Nary a care in the world have we
How can love survive?,You're fond of bonds and you own a lot
I have a plane and a diesel yacht
Plenty of nothing you haven't got

In the face of the freezing breezes
You reach your goals in your comfy old rolls
Or in one of your Mercedeses,Two millionaires with a dream are we
We'll make our love survive,How can I show what I feel for you?
I cannot go out and steal for you
I cannot die like Camile for you
How can love survive?,You millionaires with financial affairs
Are too busy for simple pleasure
When you are poor it is toujours l'amour
For l'amour all the poor have leisure,Caught in our gold plated chains are we
Lost in our wealthy domains are we
Trapped by our capital gains are we
But we'll keep romance alive,Trapped by our capital gains"

And everytime it turns another somersault,
Another day goes by.
And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it.
No, you can't stop it even if you tried.
So, I'm not going to worry,
No, I'm not going to worry,
Everytime I see another day go by.,[He]
While somersaulting at a cockeyed angle,
We make a cockeyed circle 'round the sun.
And when we circle back to where we started from,
Another year has run.,[Both]
And there's no way to stop it,
No, there's no way to stop it,
If the earth wants to roll around the sun.
You're a fool if you worry.
You're a fool if you worry,
Over anything but little number one.,[He]
That's you!,[She]
That's I!,[He]
And I!,[Other He]
And me!,[He]
That all absorbing character.,[She]
That fastinating creature.,[Other He]
That super special feature,,[All]
Me!,[He]
So every star on every whirling planet,
And every constellation in the sky,
Revolves around the center of the universe,
That lovely thing called, I.,[All]
And there's no way to stop it.
No, there's no way to stop it,
And I know, though I cannot tell you why (sigh).
Just as long as I'm living,
Just as long as I'm living,
There'll be nothing else as wonderful as I.
I! I! I! Nothing else as wonderful as I!"

Baby, it's time to think
Better beware, be canny and careful
Baby, you're on the brink,You are sixteen going on seventeen
Fellows will fall in line
Eager young lads and rogues and cads
Will offer you food and wine,Totally unprepared are you
To face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared are you
Of things beyond your ken,You need someone older and wiser
Telling you what to do
I am seventeen going on eighteen
I'll take care of you,I am sixteen going on seventeen

Fellows I meet may tell me I'm sweet
And willingly I'll believe,I am sixteen going on seventeen
Innocent as a rose
Bachelor dandies, drinkers of brandies

Of things beyond my ken,I need someone older and wiser
Telling me what to do

Burning holes in the nighttime
Open scars cut like barbed wire
White lies flying high like a ceasefire
Dropping flags on the shoreline

Cause what you don't know
Can haunt you,And all we ever wanted
Was sunlight and honesty
Highlights to want to repeat
Lets get away from here and
Live like the movies do
I won't mind when its over,At least I didn't think for a while,So lets run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all well ever need is another day
We can slow down cause tomorrow is a mile away,And live like shooting stars
Cause happy endings hardest to fake,Sunsets on power lines
Making a break for the otherside
Heading out to where that sunshine
45 millimeter rolling like we lost time
Polaroids and outcast
Rather burnout young than grow up fast
And we could be forever future bound
Cause all I need is time and now
And I could leave this past behind me
(And all we ever wanted, was sunlight and honesty)
And maybe I'll see a way for me to stay

And live like shooting stars
Cause everything was never the same,And I want to let you know
I want to let you go
But I just can't bring myself to speak
But this is how it goes,The end credits the roll
This bridge was built over kerosine
But we can watch it
(Burn down)

Well keep running through the dark
And all well ever need is another day

When big larry came round just to put him down
Spongebob turned into a clown
And no girl ever wants to dance
with a fool who went and (rip) ripped his pants,I no I shouldnt mope around I shouldnt curse
But the pain feels so much worse
Cause windin up with no1 is a lot less fun then a burn
from the sun Or sand in your buns!,Now I learned a lesson I wont soon forget
So listen and u wont regret
Be true to urself dont miss your chance

No matter the obstacles, I always wind up at your side

I find my way back home to you again,It's like a drawer that keeps opening
no matter how hard I try to close it
You're flying high in the sky
but you always come back to me
I have a hard time dealing with us parting
but everything is as it always was,On the countless paths away,
I discovered you
and the heart that I had tried to empty
you filled back up like this,I always run into you at the end of my steps
Stop... stop...,I go looking for you in time that's stopped
No matter the obstacles, I always wind up at your side
My long, long journey ends and now I go back
I find my way back home to you again,I open the quietly sleeping room
I take out my memories
You rise clearly
above the shattered time,I live on, keeping you in my lost heart
Stop... stop...,I go looking for you in time that's stopped
No matter the obstacles, I always wind up at your side
My long, long journey ends and now I go back
I find my way back home to you again,I turn the world over in search of
the story that only you can complete
Even if I lose everything, you are all I need,All of the lights are out here
Hug me,If I close my eyes, it rushes in soundlessly
You pile up in full again in my heart
I don't need anybody but you
I'm not done until the day you come back to my side"

Will you still be sending me a Valentine?
Birthday greetings bottle of wine?,If I'd been out
Till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?,You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you,I could be handy
Mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride,Doing the garden
Digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?,Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save (we shall scrimp and save)
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave,Send me a postcard
Drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer
Fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?"

He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine,Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
For a fish and finger pie
In summer meanwhile back,Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway,Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare,So how could I dance with another

Well she looked at me
And I, I could see

She wouldn't dance with another

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand,In mine
Well, we danced through the night,And we held each other tight

As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more,She goes down the stairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free,She,... (we gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (sacrified most of our lives)
Home (we gave her everything money could buy),Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy, our baby's gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?,She (we never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years,Friday morning, at nine o'clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Greeting a man from the Motortrade,She (what did we do that was wrong)
Is Having (we didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy),Something inside, that was always denied,

In an octopus' garden
In the shade
We would shout
And swim about
The coral that lies
Beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy
For every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy
And they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy
You and me
No one there to tell us
What to do

Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
With you
In an octopus' garden
With you
In an octopus' garden

Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag

They look just like two gurus in drag""

You know how hard it can be

Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack

See you make your way through the crowd
And say ""Hello"", little did I know...,That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...,Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes"",So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while,'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...,Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""

Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said...,Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said,Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you & that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

Been here all along

Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself

That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile
Since she brought you down.,You say you're fine—I know you better than that

I wear sneakers

In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry,I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me,Can't you se that I'm the one

The moment I can see it
Yes, yes

You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine,Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parent's mistakes,But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes

You are the best thing that's ever been mine,And I remember that fight, 2: 30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street,Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone,You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter

Hold on, never turn back

Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl,I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room,Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream,Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march,And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride to be
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me,You wish it was me
Don't you?
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow,You need to hear me out
And they said speak now
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow,Your time is running out
And they said speak now
I hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace
There's the silence, there's my last chance,I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl,Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait, or say a single vow
You need to hear me out

And you'll say let's run away now
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around

Counting my footsteps, praying the floor wont fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine
You paint a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight,Well I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need to give love then take it away,And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John,I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark twisted games?
When I loved you so
I should've known
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have dried lifeless eyes,Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town
Dear John,I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song

Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in a song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days [?], this end game isn't won
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it,[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]

I haven't seen them in a while,You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why,'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die,So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December all the time,These days I haven't been sleeping,Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind,You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye,So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine,I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I'd go back to December all the time,I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming,If we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

It's the morning of your very first day
You say ""Hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
""You know I haven't seen you around before."",'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen,You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends,'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round but
In your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen,When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine,And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried,'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found that time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen,La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la,Your very first day

Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors."

And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team

Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week

You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well
Yeah,'Cause there we are again when I loved you so

If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs,Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you,So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours,You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine,And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours,And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you,'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours,So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind

Same old, tired lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you,Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?"" across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts, counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you,This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder-struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you,The lingering question kept me up, 2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you,This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder-struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew,This night is flawless, don't you let it go

This is me praying that
This was the very first page, not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else,Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

You, pickin' on the weaker man,Well you can take me down
With just one single blow

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You, have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again,I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold

With that same big loud opinion but
Nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing.,But all you are is mean
All you are is mean

Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all,Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red,Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
To your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong,Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red,Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red,Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red,Yeah, yeah, red
Oh, burning red,And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head

I should have known, I should have known,That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around,Maybe I was naive,
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know,I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around,And there you are on your knees,
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry,'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now,Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late

Had gone all wrong
Or been trampled on
And lost
And thrown away,Got to the hallway
Well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice,All the roses

Waited for something

The crowds in stands went wild

The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero,On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age,Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made,And bring on all the pretenders,One day, we will be remembered,I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the sidelines wishing for right now,We are the Kings and the Queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town,And The Cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd!"",'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans,Got to rule the world,Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders,One day, we will be remembered,Hold on to spinning around,Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall,Will you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if —God forbid— fate should step in,And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine,Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you

I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away

I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

And we talk and window shop 'til I forgot all their names,I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you

God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you,There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarves
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world,Now I know why all the trees change in the fall

Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up
Don't you ever grow up
Never grow up
Just never grow up"

Lit through the darkness at 1: 58
Words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you love me so why did you go away?
Away...,I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July 9th, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms,Now I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips,I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes & then you pull me in
I'm not much for dancin' but for you I did,Because I love your handshake, meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of sayin' something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions,And I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips,So I watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are,And I hope the sun shines & it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather & time
But I never planned on you changing your mind,So, I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips,Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last"

Feels like I'm falling and I
Am lost in your eyes, you make me crazier, crazier, crazier,I watched from a distance as you
Made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue and I wanted to know
How that would feel and you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see

He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows

The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do,Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be,She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do,So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cuz he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart

Then discovered (Then discovered)

Are we out of the woods yet?

Then fall back together (Back together),Uh, your necklace hanging from my neck

I walked out, I said ""I'm setting you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up you were looking at me,You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me,Are we out of the woods yet?

The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away,[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day,[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today,[Chorus]

Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22,Dancing like 22, yeah, 22, yeah yeah,It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have you!"

I would tell the story of us
How we met
And the sparks flew instantly,People would say
That they're the lucky ones
I used to know,My place was a spot next to you,Now im searchin the room,For an empty seat,Cuz lately I dont even know,What page you're on,Oh a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that,I wish you knew
So many walls up,I can't break through
Now im standin alone
In a crowded room
And we're not speakin,And im dyin to know
Is it killin you
Like its killing me yea
I dont know what to say
Since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks alot like tragedy now
Next chapter
How'd we end up this way
See me nervously
Pulling my clothes
Trying to look busy
And you do doin your best
To avoid me
Im starting to think one day
I'll tell the story of us
So i was losing my Mind
When you saw you here
But you held your pride
Like you should've held me
Oh im scared to
See the ending
Why are we pretending
This is nothing
I'd tell you i miss you
But i dont know how
I never heard so
I was quite this loud
Now im standing alone
In a crowded room
And we're not speakin
And im dyin to know
Is it killin you
Like its killing me
I dont know what to say
Since a twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks alot like tragedy now
This is lookin like a contest
And they act like they care less
But i liked it better
When you were on my side
The battle is in your hands now
But i will lay my armour down
If you say you will
Never let them fight
So many things that
You wish i knew
But the story of us
Might be ending soon
Now im standin alone
In a crowded room
And we're not speakin
And im dyin to know
Is it killin you
Like its killin me
I dont know what to say
Since a twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us
Looks alot like tragedy now now now
And we're not speakin
And im dying to know
Is it killing you
Like its killing me
I dont know what to say
Since a twist of fate
Cuz we're going down
And the story of us
Looks alot like tragedy now
The End."

And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around,You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby

You're not sorry, no no oh,Looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know,And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore

And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

In wildest dreams

This love came back to me, oh oh

Struggled through the night with someone new

Flickered in my mind, only you

On sinking ships
You showed up just in time,This love is good, this love is bad

But I'm still a thug,I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing, but I just made caramel delight

Well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch

Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough,You kiss on sidewalks
You fight then you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face,Pauses, then says
You're my best friend

We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is dont let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint.
And I love in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain.
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild.
And I never saw you coming

Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, skip the conversation and you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day,And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground,Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd,'Cause darling, it was good

Tonight I'm gonna dance, like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance, if I'm not dancing with you,It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood

Disappear when you come back

Nowhere to hide

Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta,I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone

Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and,And he can be my jailer

Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I-,[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it

People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it

Deep fears that the world would divide us

All you had to do was stay,All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay,Here you are now
Calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside,But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye
Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay,Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back,Now it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy

All you had to do was stay,All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
Let me remind you this was what you wanted,You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this,Oh
All you had to do was stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay,Hey, now you say you want it back
Now it's just too late,Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back

I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up on my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me, baby, like tryin' on clothes,[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do,[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa,[Post-Chorus]

Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury,[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room

Is the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough,[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa

If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me
We never said ""our love was evergreen""
Or ""as unchanging as the sea""

Stop and think of me
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen
Don't think about the way

Silent and resigned
Imagine me trying too hard

There will never be a day

Can it be Christine? Bravo!

How young and innocent we were

But I remember her

They have their seasons, so do we
But please promise me that sometimes

Here, I bring the finished score.
Don Juan Triumphant!,Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting round the stage
Our Don Juan must lose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...,No doubt she'll do her best
It's true, her voice is good
She knows, though
Should she wish to excell
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me, her teacher
Her teacher...,PHANTOM

Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night,Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before,Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight

Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you would help me to do
All that you dreamed I could
Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and momumental
Sing for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle,Too many years fighting back tears
Why cant the past just die,Wishing you were somehow here again

No more silent tears
No more gazing accross the wasted years

I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature
Detailing how my theatre is to be run
You have not...,(fading to the Phantom's voice),followed my instructions
I shall give you one last chance,(Phantom singing)
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the pageboy
And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent, which makes my casting, in a word, ideal,(Phantom talking)
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five
Which will be kept empty for me
Should these commands be ignored
A disaster beyond your imagination will occur
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant

Rise up and reach the world
No one would listen
I alone could hear the music,Then at last, a voice in the gloom
Seemed to cry ""I hear you;
I hear your fears,
Your torment and your tears."",She saw my loneliness
Shared in my emptiness
No one would listen
No one but her
Heard as the outcast hears,No one would listen
No one but her
Heard as the outcast hears..."

Past all thought of right or wrong -
one final question: how long should we two wait, before we're one ...?,When will the blood begin to race the sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flames, at last, consume us ...?
Past the point of no return the final threshold -
the bridge is crossed, so stand and watch it burn ...

Lead me, save me from my solitude ...
Say you want me with you, here beside you ...

On the first night that we met
Together
We've been happy,I have very few regrets

Have not been hard to face
But lately little changes,Have been slowly taking place
You're always finding something
Is wrong in what I do
But you can't rearrange my life,Because it pleases you
You've got to love me
For what I am
For simply being me,Don't love me
For what you intend
Or hope that I will be
And if you're only using me,To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go
I must be free,If what you want
Isn't natural for me
I won't pretend to keep you
What I am I have to be,The picture of perfection
Is only on your mind
For all your expectations
Love can never be designed,We either take each other
For everything we are
Or leave the life
We've made behind,And make another start
You've got to love me
For what I am
For simply being me,Don't love me
For what you intend
Or hope that I will be
And if you're only using me,To feed your fantasy

But freedom only helps you say goodbye.
It took awhile for me to learn that nothing comes for free.
The price I've paid is high enough for me.,I know I need to be in love,
I know I've wasted too much time.
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world,
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find.,So here I am with pockets full of good intentions,
But none of them will comfort me tonight.

Rising on the shore the oceans came
Walks along the waves of velveteen
His only thought was love for me
love for me,Couldn't we stay
Or must we go
Couldn't we stay and watch the splashing rocks we throw
Only a fool would want to leave the paradise that I find whenever you're around
Only a fool
Only a fool"

No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it,So I've made my mind up
I must live my life alone
And though it's not the easy way
I guess I've always known,I'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories and I'll find
That there is someone to believe in and to live for
Something I could live for,All the years of useless search
Have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days
Will be my only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can,What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song
And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love"

Both afraid to say we're just to far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play

When I'd start to play folks to say
Sounds a little goofus to me,Corn fed chords appeal to me
I like rustic harmony
Hold a note and change the key
Hey but that's goofus,Not according to the rules
That you learned in music schools
But the folks just dance like fools
They sure go for goofus,Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long

So I stepped out with an outfit of my own,Got together a new kind of orchestra

It's never really made it but it's tried,Well, there's two sides to every conversation
But with you babe, that's no consolation
Silence is golden, let me put you on hold
Danglin' on your love line, baby, it's growin' old,Well, I don't know how to say it
Cause I never thought I could
God know I've tried so many times,But there's two sides, there's another side of me
There's the one you think you live with, the one you never see
It's never really lived, but it's never really died
It's never really made it, but it's tried,To every creation
We're no revelation
One sees the wrong, and one sees the right
The other side of me just caught a flight,Goodbye"

Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying everything new

I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me
Don't cry for me Argentina

Have I said to much? There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me
To know that every word is true"

As I grew people called it self-deceiving

Something new yet familiar's in the air
I feel it everywhere
Like a child's eyes on a Christmas night
I'm looking at you now
Findin' answers to my prayers,It's a new day for those good old dreams
One by one it seems they're comin' true
Here's the morning that my heart had seen
Here's the morning that just had to come through,Same old stage but what a change of scene
No more dark horizons, only blue
It's a new day for those good old dreams
All my life I've dreamed of lovin' you,You're a spark of a long forgotten fire
You're a touch of a slowly growin' wind
You're a taste of the ever-changing seasons
Tellin' me there are some things that don't end,We have left all the darkness far behind us
All those hopes that we had along the way
Have made it to this day
Like an old love song gone for much too long
You hear it once again
And it carries you away,It's a new day for those good old dreams

But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say, when you know it's not true
Even harder to write, when you know that's a lie
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real, like
""Who would you live for?""
""Who would you die for?""
And ""Would you ever kill?""
Oh, oh, oh, oh,Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Takin' my time on my ride.

So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio,And now I just sit in silence,Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel,There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel,I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought,Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence,I ponder of something terrifying
Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep - please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
There's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think,And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think,I have these thoughts
So often I ought,To replace that slot
With what I once bought
Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence,I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it's dire
My time today,I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought

I'm open a moment and close when you show it,
Before you know it I'm lost at sea,
And now that I write and think about it,

Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,

'Cause the next moment, before you know it,
Time is slowing and it's frozen still,
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night,
right? Fight it, take the pain, ignite it,
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it,
To a tree, tell it, ""You belong to me,

And I have some news for you, you must obey me."",You are surrounding all my surroundings,

That I killed, killed you in and now I know I'm alone
I walk to you, rain falls from you
Can you wash me, can you drown me?,I wanna be a lot of things, so much pent up inside of me
I wanna be stronger, too long I've sat here undecidedly
Planning strategy, half of me know it's all just a fallacy
Failing miserably, drastically and then I crash dramatically
Into a wall I've hit a hundred times before
And yet I still ignore the dark red blood stains on the floor
And I'm back in front of you, Lord, with the blood on the floor
Is the blood mine or yours? Don't wanna do this anymore,Back and forth between me and me and who you call me to be
You see a man free who thinks he has to buy a key
To a door but he can't 'cause he's poor and he can't
Fall down anymore 'cause he's already on the floor
And his heart is broken and all and this is his scar
But it's warm from crying 'cause he will try nine times
To realize nine crimes but he has more than nine lives
So he picks himself up and keeps fighting for the prize again,Here I come again to you
Just to show the blood soaked through
Through my bones and all I own
Is there a way for me to grow?
I walk to you, rain falls from you
Can you wash me, can you drown me, please?,Every time I feel selfish ambition is taking my vision
My crime is my sentence, repentance is taking commission
It's taking a toll on my soul, I'm screaming submission and
I don't know if I am dying or living
'Cause I will save a face for name's sake
Abuse grace, take a aim to obtain a new name in a newer place
But my name is lame, I can't walk and I ain't the same
And my name became a new destiny to the grave and
They say the ocean's blue but it's black right now
In the dark, on the sand, looking out at my crowd
Depression and drowning singing now the full parts
Of lightning reveals where the ocean stops and the sky starts
I've been told by the sky that the ocean I shall win
But it's hard for me to see where ocean stops, and where sky begins
A random strike of light reminds me of what is true
But right now the ocean is black and black the sky is too"

Who hates what he believes and loves it at the same time,Here's my brother and his head's screwed up
But that's alright.,Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are friend of me, sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man,Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle

But will they be alive tomorrow?,They think this thing is a highway
If it was a highway
We'd have a tempo change every other time change
Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music, I don't know how I would've fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity is on the free when I'm playin' shows,They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
Will they be alive tomorrow?,I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat, in a gas mask
If you ask Zack, he's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's back track, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list
But the problem is
There's another list that exist and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my calvary,All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless,They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway

Something soft and soaked in pain
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door
As he cranked out those dismal chords
And his four walls declared him insane,I found my way
Right time, wrong place
As I pled my case,You're the judge
Set me free
You're the judge
Set me free,I know my soul's freezing
Hell's hot for good reason
So please, take me,Three lights are lit
But the fourth one's out
I can tell cause it's a bit darker
Than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought
Of light bulbs in this house
So I head out
Down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions
And I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections
And I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out
And now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking
'Wow, I probably should've stayed inside my house.',I found my way
Right time wrong place

Set me free

Set me free,I know my soul's freezing

To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving, like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading please, oh please on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free
I don't want to be the one, be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands
I'll tell the moon, take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon.,I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.,Why am I not scared in the morning
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.,But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant.
Please tell them you have no plans for me.
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell them.,On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
And the trees they await and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling there's something we need
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four.,I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.,Why am I not scared in the morning
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.,But I'll tell them

That gives the demons and angels purpose
They fly around while we are walking
And mold our emotions just to please them,I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly, with no known fear
And the ground, taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing,All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing, remind us of things that no body cares about
And honestly we're probably more suicidal than ever now,If you decide to live by, what you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe
We can take apart our very heart and the light will set you free,I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly, with no hope, no fear
And the ground, taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing,I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly, with no hope, no fear
And the ground, taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing,How frustrating, and so degrading
His time, we're wasting
And time will fly by and the sky will cry as light is fading
And he is waiting, oh so patiently
While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability
Please think about why you can't sleep in the evening
And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle, and I promise you this is mine

It's sorry (sorry)

'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away
I disguise
And I will lie
And I will take my precious time
As the days melt away
As I stand in line
And I die as I wait, as I wait on my crime,And I'll try to delay what you make of my life,But I don't want your way
I want mine,I'm dying and I'm trying
But believe me I'm fine,But I'm lying,I'm so very far from fine
And I
I can feel the pull begin,I feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin
It will start
To break up and fall apart
(break)
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I will keep the lights on in this place
'Cause I don't wanna fall, fall away
Every time I feel selfish ambition
Is taking my vision
My crime is my sentence
Repentance is taking commission
It's taking a toll
On my soul
I'm screaming submission and
I don't know if I am dying or living
'Cause I will save face
For name's sake
Abuse grace
Take aim to obtain a new name
And a newer place
But my name is lame
I can't walk and I ain't the same
And my name became
A new destiny to the grave
And I, I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin
It will start to break up and fall apart
(break)
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I don't wanna fall, fall away
I'll keep the lights on in this place

And the old man sings rewind
I wonder when, in this timeline
We break to the other side,Maybe there's a span of time
When we feel we're neither nor
Not wanting to go back again
And not wanting to go forth,That point in life must be pretty dark
And hopeless, terrifying
And if you're asking me when that is
It must be tonight
It must be tonight
It must be tonight
It must be tonight,The old man sits all by himself
And thinks of better years
Ahen he used to believe in stars
And would dream away his fears,The young boy moves so fast
He doesn't see the stars above
And all his dreams are crushed by old men
Who didn't dream enough,We must all agree
There's a point in life when darkness breaks
Our brittle hopes and dreams
And I'd say
It must be tonight
It must be tonight
It must be tonight

It must be tonight

To what I've done and what I'm doing

And believe me that's what all the kids are doing
What kids are doing are killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell
And if you're one of them then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free...
Am I right? Of course I am
Convince me otherwise would take all night,Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say

And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully plain taxi cab
A cab, had a cleared out back
And two men started to unpack,Driving once again
But now this time there were three men
And then I heard one of them say:
""I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day"",Then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot
Where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more
Pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searching for,Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked them ""am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead?""
And then one turned around to say:
""We're driving toward the morning sun
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone.""
I said: ""Don't be afraid.""
I said: ""Don't be afraid."""

End of my ways as a walking denial

You hear me screaming ""Father!""

One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote,Quickly moving towards a storm
Moving forward, torn
Into pieces over reasons
Of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that
When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light
Comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're suppose to be?,This is not what you're suppose to see
Please, remember me? I am suppose to be
King of a kingdom or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
This situation's becoming dire
My treehouse is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned,Down in the forest we'll sing a chorus
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote
Down in the forest we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire"

No one around,
In the dark cold night, I hear a sound
In my head keeping track of everything you've ever said.
Must be something, but it's nothing, so I just go back to bed.,It's four, crack the door to the hallway of my dreams,
But it seems that my hallway keeps closing in on me,
Forcing me out,
Making me think about you and how you're gone.
I see four o'five with teary eyes and then I write this song.,[Chorus]
And I just can't believe that it has to be this way,
You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day,
I saw your face, I saw your light, you ran the race, you fought the fight,
But now it's all being torn down for me tonight.,And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say,
But I need to know if you thought of me at all today,
'Cause everyday, I walk past the place you left five days of the week,
And now it's ten after four, and I am taken by sleep.
[End Chorus],Spending hours on end
Deciding what I'd say to a friend
If I ever saw 'em again,,'Cause I don't know if I know, and don't wanna come across the wrong way.
'Cause I don't know if I know, but I know I wanna see your face today.,Then somebody told me they saw you cry and break down.
Do you know how hard that is to get around and think about?
It's not like you to let emotions get the best of things,
Especially when everything is hanging in the air we breath.,[Chorus],I'll sing a song to you, my friend.
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.
I'll sing a song to you, my- Let's go!,Friend. Yeah(3x),I'll sing a song to you, my friend.(4x)"

He's only a few feet in front of me
And I'll look left and right sometimes
But I'll fall in line,No one looks up anymore
'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye
And Heaven forbid they see you cry
As we fall in line,And about this time of every year
The line will go to the ocean pier
And walk right off into the sea
And then we fall asleep,And as we near the end of land
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand
I ask myself the question
Why I fall in line,Then out of the corner of my eye
I see a spaceship in the sky
And hear a voice inside my head:
Follow me instead,Follow me instead
Follow me
Then the wages of war will start
Inside my head with my counterpart,And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase:
This line's the only way
And then I start down the sand
My eyes are focused on the end of land
But again the voice inside my head says:
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Follow me instead
Take me up, seal the door
I don't want to march here anymore
I realize that this line is dead
So I'll follow You instead
So then You put me back in my place
So I might start another day
And once again I will be
In a march to the sea"

I kinda like it

Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.,The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears
And my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near,When the sun is coming, windowsills
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun make the hills its grave,I'm never what I like

My prayers schizophrenic
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on
By the time the night wears off, the dust is down,And shadows burn
I will rise and stand my ground
Waiting for the night's return.

If I fall...

And build yourself a home
You have learned

You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind,He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air
How he used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a pantaloon,You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind,You like to sleep alone
It's colder than you know
Cause your skin is so
Used to colder bones
It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmares and your frights,You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends, they fertilize
The ground you walk
So lose your mind,You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends, they fertilize

Lose your mind"

They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?,They think this thing is a highway
If it was a highway
We'd have a tempo change every other time change
Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music, I don't know how I would've fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity is on the free when I'm playin' shows,They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
Will they be alive tomorrow?,I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat, in a gas mask
If you ask Zack, he's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's back track, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list
But the problem is
There's another list that exist and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my calvary,All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless,They say ""stay in your lane boy, lane boy""

And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn,It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming,But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn,When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you,Let it burn

But you don't really know
And everything in your past
You wanna let it go,I been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone

Then maybe,You got it, you got it bad

Hang up and you call right back,You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when,You stuck in the house you don't wanna have fun
'Cos all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else

That used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money all my cars,You can have it all and
Flowers, cards and candy I do it just 'cos
I said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know I really adore you,All my people know what's going on
Look at your mate help me sing my song
Tell her I'm your man
You're my girl,I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies, say I'm your girl
You're my man
Promise to love you the best I can,See I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Every one of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad,You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back,You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when,You stuck in the house you don't wanna have fun
'Cos all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else
You got it bad
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when
You stuck in the house you don't wanna have fun

Sometime wanna hug hold hands slow dance while the record spins
Opened up your heart cause you said I made you feel so comfortable
Used to play back then now you all grown up like Rudy Huxtable
I could be your +Bud+ you could beat me up
Play fight in the dark then we both make up

Why you, got me so messed up

Be a good girl now turn around and get these whipping
You know you like it like that
You don't have to fight back here's a pillow bite that
And I'll be setting seperate plays
So on all these seperate days your legs can go they seperate ways,Tell me again (Tell me again my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends

You ain't been nothing but a friend to me (shawty)
And a nigga never ever dreamed it be (shawty)
Up in here kissing, hugging, screaming, touching (shawty)
Up in the bathtub rubber dubbing (shawty)

I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn,[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn,[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might ruin you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn,Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn,[Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feelin ain't the same by myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my booo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn),[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might ruin you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon'learn)
Let it burn (gotta let it burn)
Gotta let it burn,Deep down you know its best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn,[Bridge]
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah),[Breakdown]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh,So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return,[Chorus]

But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to

I'm never gonna tell you nothing wrong

Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately I been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that

I really wanna give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss
Girl you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say
I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
'Cause we will never be the same
I've been standing in gas
And you have been the flame
So I know sorry, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to get through
Gotta move this mountain

But I keep climbing and hoping things would change

Just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be,Why you just leave me, just leave me be
This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holding on
See no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together baby yeah
And these hills that I'm traveling up
She ain't showing me love, I'm down on my luck
Ooh, I'm done, oh
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains,But I keep climbing and hoping things would change

The way she gettin' low, I'm like, Yeah, just work that out for me
She asked for one more dance
And I'm like, Yeah, how the hell am I supposed to leave?
And I said,Yeah, yeah
Shorty got down on me and said, Come and get me
Yeah, yeah

My outfit's ridiculous, in the club lookin' so conspicuous
And rowl! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady I'm a milk the cow
Forget about game I'm a spit the truth
I won't stop till I get em in they birthday suits
So gimmie the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes,I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin' then I put em on foot patrol
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris fill cups like double D's
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say,Yeah, yeah
Shorty got down on me and said, Come and get me
Yeah, yeah
I got so caught up I forgot she told me

Live your life and I'll live mine

Go your way

One last time, and no one's there
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, no...)
Drove all night, just to beat you home
Would you mind if I waited?
Would you mind if I wait right here?,And I really, really, wanna love you
And I'm really only yours
Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know
We really had something special, it's hard tryna let it go
I'm just being honest, I'm still in the moment,Would you mind if I still loved you?
Would you mind if things don't last?
Would you mind if I hold onto
You so that I won't crash?,Up all night, can't let go
Won't stop trying, need you to know
It's worth the fight, if i get back come
Hope you don't mind I waited
Would you mind if I wait right here?,And I really, really, wanna love you
And I'm really only yours
Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know

If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all

Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did

To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance

Today is the day that I end all the lyin' and the playin'
And the bullshit, girl I'm sorry, baby I'm sorry but I can no longer

I guess only time gon' tell
You gotta give me dirty love
I guess I'm down too
When I can't find any words I lie
Look up and see the stars in a perfect line
The feeling of love is a global thing,So tell me how you feel (how you feel)
Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes
Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized
Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized
You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though
I'm looking at you and I swear it's been a long road
A great ass, a better mind, what a combo
You know you pretty and you winning with the convo
She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight
She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way
But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling
I just love the times when I'm beside ya
Holding me down cause you're my rider
I look in your eyes and I get higher
There's nothing in this world I hold tighter
Without you I feel uneven,Make every day our love season
Baby girl you know you're my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
Cause I don't need no more rivals
(You gotta give me that)
I put that on the Bible

I told my ex for me relationships a no-no
And here I am thinking we perfect like a photo
You looking at me like right now you need some mo', mo'
I know you ready and willing but that ain't my place
I know you wanna settle down, all on your face
Feeling startin' to get too familiar
So cover up this broken love treason,Make every day our love season

I'ma love ya till my time's gone,You say I see ya side by side
Like a visionary, I can't see me falling

Long as you coming home, girl, I don't mind,I'm just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that's third base
It's okay if you work late, we can still party like it's your birthday,We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place, blow her own gas, no role'
When we in the bed she like to roleplay, tell her friend to join in both ways
I don't mind If you dance on a pole
That don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind when you work until three
If you're leaving with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes
Long as you coming home, girl, I don't mind"

You're gonna open my door and I'ma reach over and open yours

Pancakes and eggs, I owe you breakfast in bed, oh baby
And your orange juice sitting on a coaster
Toast on the side' baby, strawberry and grape jelly,You finished, let me get that drink
Pull the curtain from the window
Time to get up, baby
Let me make this bed up, baby,Today we going shopping blowing 30 on me
Make it 60, screaming like you really love me
Skip dinner and we gonna rent a movie
You order Chinese food right before you do me
You're coming on strong, baby, let me wash my hair

Take out the trash with nothing but your t-shirt on
I'm gonna press your shirt, gonna wrinkle mine's up
In the kitchen going crazy, we don't give a what
Where you want me?
Give it to me, baby, baby, babe

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the
way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I dont know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions,Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever
had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was
creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and
is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what,I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our
relationship,These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the

When, what, and how I'mma let this come out of
my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with (over with)
I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come
near me
I said ""one second baby please hear me"",These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the

Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions,This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever
had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely
even know,I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man,enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please,These are my confessions

My chick on the side said she got one on the

If I don't get another chance it'll be hard to get focused,
Give me one chance to make it work!,It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy)
'Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby)
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
Oh I wish I could find you girl
Said I'm about to go crazy (About to go crazy)
'Cause I been needin' you lately (Needing you lately)
The love of my life but I wasn't loving you right baby,It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy)
'Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby)
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
I just wish I could find you girl
So I'm about to go crazy (About to go crazy)
'Cause I been needin' you lately (Needing you lately)
I'm goin' outta my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now,(Mmm your gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
(Your gonna need me, need me one day)
And that day's here
(Mmm your gonna want me back)
And ya man gotta shed tears
I'm sittin' by the phone 
Realizing she ain't ever coming home..."

Girl you know I tried, I worked hard to provide all the material things
That I thought, would make you happy
I'm confused, can you make me understand?
'Cause I tried to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool, maybe I was blind,But never took time to see,Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
(Ah ah ah ah)
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave?
(Please don't go away)
Baby help me
Without you my whole world is fallin' apart, and I'm goin' crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone
(Oh girl, I love you) I need you to come back home
(You know I need you) I don't want to be alone uhh,Girl I put your love up on the shelf
And I guess I just left it to die,now we're not together, 'cause I hurt you too many times
And now you're not around
I wish for every moment of time that got wasted, we used it to make sweet love
Baby be my guide please take my hand
Want you to know that I got you If you need it

So innocent she seemed but I was fooled

I can't, get to work on time,Can't believe the words to her I just said
But who the hell argue 'n' fight
Like dogs at 6 in the morning? (in the mornin)
I know it's gonna be some more shit tonight
Our pastor's callin', tellin' me

And my friends can't recognize me
'Cuz I took a chance on love (love)

For you I gave my heart,And turned my back against the world
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl
I done damn near lost my mama
I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man
That I never thought I'd be.
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers,I done took all I can take
But you leave me no options girl
I can't deny how much I love you

I'm losin my mind,Cant figure out who's wrong or right
I know it's you I love
But then I also know it's you I don't like
You claim you hate who I was
But that's the reason you here now
You think I don't know what's up
But sweetheart that's what ruined us
I ain't afraid to say I got needs
But the only time you here for me
Is when the bottles poppin'
And everything is sweet
But I I'm tired of sleeping in the other room
Spending them long nights
Trying to figure out what in the hell
In my heart I ain't do right. (Ooh for you)
For you I gave my heart,And turned my back against the world (back against the world)
'Cause you were my girl, girl (girl), girl

There's only one way to tear it up
Yeah
I'm willing to tell you
Everything I let stand between us
But what if I tell you too much,What about you babe
Will you tell me
All the freaky things you are

That you won't wanna stay with my love
Oh baby
If I can be sure
Inside out that you know exactly
The man that comes to see you
I'll go deep as I can
Giving you the rest of my love
But what if I tell you too much,Uhhhhh
So much to explore
So much we have yet to discover
I ask myself
Should I go there
Should I do it
Yeeeaaahhh oooooh
Can I give it to you fully
Can you handle it,Can you handle it
If I go there baby with you
We gon' lay it out
We gon' tear it up

Voluptuous, I love your confidence
You got it, you got it
Seduce me baby, seduce me,Just to get my attention
Sent a note and a drink
When we made our connection
She just nodded and winked
On this note it said
Its bout time we get together
Lets dance now, hook up later
We can do whatever
She had confidence
But its all part of the game
Cuz to her, though I'm whipped,
Don't really mean a thing
She knew just what I liked
And now I'm thirsty for more,(Chorus)

Sensuous, sexy, erotic,
How you working your body

Baby turn around, stick it out,
I wanna see it
She make the first move, smooth, intoxicatin'
She plays me
I'm fightin' not to lose control
Now I'm feelin' a little tension
Don't know whos watchin
Getting big
In too deep, and I can't stop it

Down wit you, down wit ya,Baby whatever you want, girl you got it
I'll let ya satisfy
Cuz its so hard to resist, oh your body
Got me on fire
Got vivid thoughts in my mind
Of positions that im gonna try
But is it worth all the hurt
Should I risk it just for one night
Once I give in, shes gonna win,
Either way I lose
But I gotta have you,Im tryin to chill, but she got me on the spot
Shes so cocky, and the way she watchin me
Got me feelin hot, uh
Shorty know that I got a girl
And I really can't break the rules, plus
Paparazzi snappin shots,
And its hard for me to shake these fools
So do I, one, put it on her, work my way to the front
Do I, two, play my part, and she will know not to pull no stunts,
Or maybe, three, chase the cat, cuz shes sendin' me on the hunt
Nah, f*ck that, I aint no punk, imma give shorty what she wants,(Chorus)
Seduction (oh you got me baby)
Sensuous, sexy, erotic, (gotta have you)
How you working your body
(We should leave right now, my cars outside)
Oooh oh, you gon' make me do it,
Do it to ya
Seduction
You throwed out your best

To get me outta control, baby

I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill,And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While havin other women on the side

You famous you can't go nowhere 'cause everytime you go there,There's hoes there so basiclly you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her ""man don't say that""
Matter fact like Pat don't say,matter fact dont say jack,
Everytime a nigga sittin on paystacks
Things come up from way way way back way back way back way way back,These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way {Way}
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to keep part 2 of my confessions"

But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh?! Come on!,I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, ""Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly-I-I?""
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up

You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it

And I'm in control,Bad ass, señoritas, two-seaters with kicks
New kicks, all in the mix
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catching bricks don't concern me
So forget it, little midget
My mind on seven digits
Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots
Saying ""You, can't, front""
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door
Shotgun in my drop, having fun
With the Don, system bassing, conversation
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, ""Give it to me now, baby"",My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control,Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far, then, ooh wee!
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
And I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up

I can feel your heart
And it's beating kinda fast, so is mine
And in this moment of silence you look me in the eyes

I need you so much

Treat love to be lonely

Hard for you to live with this
What I feel I don't even gotta write it,It's like poison in my body and there's now way to deny that my heart
Is a time bomb,When seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows
That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossipy talk, behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know
Before long you will see
That you deserve more, you derserve more
You derserve so much more
That what I'll ever be
And it's killing me girl that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell
Live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is foolin around

All the days, so dark and dim.
But it's like the rays of the sun somehow came down
To shine, when you were around
And I always thought that I'd
Never find that one.
To make me feel Forever Young.,But If I had one wish, my life to share
Would be with you and no one else
If I had open arms.
Would you have a heart to spare?
If ever you want me near.
I'll be there to run and say I'm there
Givin' you someone that understands
And a love that will never end
I can be all that you need and more.,It's time I know. I swear, never again.
See I think It's love, I've fallen in.
And I can't figure It out, the way
It's amazing how you surround me,
By the touch of your hand, If I could.
Everything I'd write, and the blue skies
Form me In your eyes to see.
Together you can me, Forever Young,But If I had one wish, my life to share,Would be with you and no one else
If I had open arms.
Would you have a heart to spare?
If ever you want me near.
I'll be glad to run and say I'm here
Someone that understands
And a love that would never end
I can be all that you need and more.,Can't keep running,
In the same direction
There's gotta be a better way,Together you and me will be.
Forever young.,But If I had one wish, my life to share
Would be with you, and no one else
If I had open arms.
Would you have a heart to spare?
And if you ever feel that you want me near.
I'll be there to run and say I'm there
Giving you someone that understands

I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do,But to give you part 2 of my confessions
Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you
'bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did,How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship
These are my confessions

Sittin here stuck on stupid, tryna figure out
When, what, and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with (over with)
I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself,Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me,I said ""one second baby please hear me""

I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do,But to give you part 2 of my confessions
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this,And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us,Please

Leaves you baby if you don't care for it,Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without,Well it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light

One!,Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus?

You gave me nothin' now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
Well we hurt each other then we do it again,You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holdin' on to what you got
When all you got is hurt,One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life, with each other
Sisters, brothers,One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

Felt the healing in her fingertips
Burning like a fire
This burning desire,I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone,But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for,I believe in the kingdom come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes I'm still running,You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross
Of my shame
Oh my shame
You know I believe it

There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care,
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere.
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace,It's a beautiful day, the sky falls
And you feel like it's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away,You're on the road but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if it doesn't ring true
You've been all over and it's been all over you,It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day,Touch me, take me to that other place
Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case,See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
A beautiful day,Touch me, take me to that other place
Reach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case,What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
You don't need it now, you don't need it now

And every shipwrecked soul, knows what it is

And drowning is no sin,You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win

In through a doorway
She brings me white golden pearls
Stolen from the sea.,She is ragin'
She is ragin'
And the storm blows up in her eyes.
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand still."

See it driving nails into souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly
a red orange scared in the valley below,Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky,In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel and the angel was overcome
Plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
See them burning crosses
see the flames higher and higher,Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue,So this guy comes up to me
His face red like the rose of a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peelin off those dollar bills
Slappin them down
One hundred
Two hundred,
And i can see the fighter planes
i can see the fighter planes
Across the mudhuts as the children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
up the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
A man breathes into a saxophone
Through the walls we hear the city groan
Outside is America
Outside is America
*Guitar Solo*
So back in my hotel room
Metallic on train and the love supreme
In the next room we hear a women scream out
As her lover's turnin' off and turnin' on the television
I can't tell the difference between ABC news Hill street Blues and a preacher of the old time gospel hour
stealin' money from the sick and the old
Well the god I believe in ain't short of cash mister
I fell along way from the hills of San Salvador
Where the sky is ripped open
And the rain pours through a gaping wound
Pelting the women and children
Pelting the women and children
Come on, come on
Into the arms of America"

And I ain't with it.,And I don't wanna be so old and gray,
Reminiscing about these better days,
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another place,
Cause everything we did,
And everything we have is stuck in the moment

A man takes a rocketship into the skies
He lives on star that's dying in the night

I was down the hold just passing time
Last time we met was a low-lit room
We were as close together as a bride and groom
We ate the food, we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time
Except you
You were talking about the end of the world,I took the money
I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You lead me on with those innocent eyes
You know I love the element of surprise
In the garden, I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart
You, you were acting,Like it was the end of the world,Love, love, love
Love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love,Love, love
Love, love, love,(Love, love, love)
In my dream I was drowning sorrows
When my sorrows, they learned to swim
(Love, love, love)
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim
Waves of regret and waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
You, you said you'd wait
Till the end of the world"

No sun in the daylight
Looks like it's chained to the ground
Chained to the ground
The warden said
The exit is sold
If you want a way out
Silver and gold,Broken back to the ceiling
Broken nose to the floor
I scream at the silence, it's crawling
It crawls under the door
There's a rope around my neck
And there's a trigger in your gun
Jesus say something
I am someone, I am someone
I am someone,Captain and kings
In the ships hold
They came to collect
Silver and gold
Silver and gold,Seen the coming and going
Seen them captains and the kings
See them navy blue uniforms
See them bright and shiny things
Bright shiny things,The temperature is rising
The fever white hot
Mister, I ain't got nothing
But it's more than you got,Chains no longer bind me
Not the shackles at my feet
Outside are the prisoners
Inside the free
Set them free
Set them free,A prize fighter in a corner is told
Hit where it hurts
Silver and gold
Silver and gold,Yep, silver and gold
This song was written in a hotel room in New York city
'Round about the time a friend or ours, little Steven,
Was putting together a record of artists against apartheid
This is a song written about a man
In a shanty town outside of Johannesburg
A man who's sick of looking down
The barrel of white South Africa
A man who is at the point
Where he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor
A man who has lost faith in the peacemakers of the west
While they argue and while they fail to support a man
Like bishop Tutu and his request for economic sanctions
Against South Africa,Am I buggin' you, I don't mean to bug ya,Okay Edge, play the blues"

She's gonna make you cry, she's gonna make you whisper and moan
And when you're dry, she draws water from the stone
I feel like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slippin' under
And I feel like I'm holding on to nothing,She wore lemon, to colour in the cold grey night
She had heaven, and she held on so tight,A man makes a picture, a moving picture
Through the light projected he can see himself up close
A man captures colour, a man likes to stare
He turns his money into light to look for her
And I feel like I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore
And I feel like I'm swimming out to her,Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Lemon, see-through in the sunlight,A man builds a city, with banks and cathedrals
A man melts the sand so he can see the world outside (you're gonna meet her there)
A man makes a car (she's your destination) and builds a road to run them on (gotta get to her)
A man dreams of leaving (she's imagination) but he always stays behind,And these are the days when our work has come asunder
And these are the days when we look for something other,Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins,Midnight is where the day begins

If you were ice... I'm water
And with your telescope... I can see further

You wanted violins... and you got Nero
You're gravity... searching for the ground
You're silence... searching for a sound
Your heart is aching... your heart is my home
It's fascinating... I know I'll never be alone,I'm rippin' the stitches
You got two hands to rub
I'm in the ditches
Of someone else's love,Love is when I lie
Love puts the blue back in my eye
Love will come again
I'll be gone again... again,If you're hunger... baby let me feed it
If your heart is full... baby let me bleed it
And happiness is for... those who don't really need it
You love me... too much
You always loved me... too much,When I was rippin' the stitches
You got two fists to rub

Of someone else's luck,Love is when I lie
Love puts the blue back in my eye
Love has come again
I am gone again,Love's got to be with a wink
Only then love gets a chance to speak
Love will come again
I'll be gone again... again,I... I can't escape myself
I hear you talk
Feeling nothing
I fear nothing
Feel...,I can hear so much
Fear nothing
I feel so much
Fear... nothing,Love has come again
I am gone again
Love is the end of history
The enemy of misery
Love has come again
I am gone again,Love is justice, a charity
Love brings with it a clarity
Love has come again
I'm alive again
Alive...,I am alive, baby I'm born again and again
And again, and again and again and again
Again"

See the sky, the burning rain
She will die and live again

I was looking for a soul that's real
Then I ran into you
And that cherry blossom tree
Was a gateway to the sun
And friendship once it's won
It's won... it's one,Northside just across the river to the Southside
That's a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide, the joy you hold
The foolish pride that gets you out the door
Up on Cedarwood Road, on Cedarwood Road,Sleepwalking down the road
Not waking from these dreams
'Cause it's never dead it's still my head
It was a warzone in my teens
I'm still standing on that street
Still need an enemy
The worst ones I can't see
You can... you can,Northside just across the river from the Southside
That's a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide and the joy you hold
The foolish pride that sends you back for more
Up on Cedarwood Road, on Cedarwood Road,If the door is open it isn't theft
You can't return to where you've never left
Blossoms falling from a tree they cover you and cover me
Symbols clashing, bibles smashing
Paint the world you need to see
Sometimes fear is the only place we can call home

The nights you filled with fireworks

Through your eyes I can see,You are such a fool
To worry like you do. Oh

For getting on with your day,Is there a time for kohl and lipstick
A time for curling hair
Is there a time for high street shopping
To find the right dress to wear,Here she comes, heads turn around
Here she comes, to take her crown,Is there a time to run for cover
A time for kiss and tell
Is there a time for different colours
Different names you find it hard to spell,Is there a time for first communion
A time for East 17
Is there a time to turn to Mecca
Is there time to be a beauty queen,Here she comes, beauty plays the clown
Here she comes, surreal in her crown,""Dici che il fiume trova la via al mare
E come il fiume giungerai a me
Oltre I confini e le terre assetate

E nell'amore non so più sperare
E quell'amore non so più aspettare."",Is there a time for tying ribbons

Our faces as pale as the dirty snow,Once I knew there was a love divine
Then came a time I thought it knew me not
Who can forgive forgiveness where forgiveness is not
Only the lamb as white as snow,And the water, it was icy
As it washed over me
And the moon shone above me,Now this dry ground it bears no fruit at all
Only poppies laugh under the crescent moon
The road refuses strangers
The land the seeds we sow
Where might we find the lamb as white as snow,As boys we would go hunting in the woods
To sleep the night shooting out the stars
Now the wolves are every passing stranger
Every face we cannot know

You say when he hits you, you don't mind

You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim

You could lip synch to the talk shows,And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing,If I could stay...

Stay... and the day would keep its trust
Stay... and the night would be enough,Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satelite television
You can go anywhere
Miami, New Orleans
London, Belfast and Berlin,And if you listen I can't call
And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout, I'll only hear you,If I could stay...
Then the night would give you up
Stay... then the day would keep its trust
Stay... with the demons you drowned
Stay... with the spirit I found
Stay... and the night would be enough,Three o'clock in the morning

As an angel runs to ground
Just the bang

Try to feel it like you do

And you're trying to get some sleep
When your thoughts are too expensive
To ever want to keep
When there's all kinds of chaos
And everyone is walking lame

Try to feel it like you do

Can't see for the smoke
I think of you and your holy book
While the rest of us choke,Tell me, tell me, what do you see?
Tell me, tell me, what's wrong with me"

Let's get undercover

If you scratch it won't disappear
It's gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you want to see what the scratching brings
Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach
Will we ever live in peace?

Armour plated suits and ties
Daddy just won't say goodbye am
Referee won't blow the whistle

I'm nearly great,But there's something I'm missing
But I'm feeling like duty free, ahh
You never really belonged to me,You're not the only one

I was powerless to resist,
we wrestled through the tango,
But I fainted in the Twist.

She is skinny but I love her like I never loved before,But If my wife should find out
The thought just makes me rave,

So let's play a game
There's a four letter word
That starts with an L
and ends with an E
It had a lot to do with
You and me,After two long years
You finally realized
That she was full of lies
She cheated on you multiple times
You don't deserve her
All she did was lie
Now that she's gone, I'm here
Always have been
Always will
But you had your chance before
And now I can't do this anymore,[chorus]
Haven't you figured it out
I'm always there to turn to
No matter what
I'm always here for you
What can't you see
You don't belong with her
You belong with me
You and me
That's the way it should be
But that was two years ago
Now I just have to walk away
And let you go
And just tell you
I told you so,You sent me a message the other day
You said you missed how it used to be
Those nights
When it was just you and me
It took you along time to
To finally see
What you're missing with her
And what you had with me
You're two years too late
I've moved on
And I'm over it now
I have to walk away
Because it took you those two years
To tell me how you really feel
I'm done crying
And done with the tears
Now its time to let you go
And all I have to say is
I told you so,[repeat chorus],Now do you see
What I've been trying to say
Remember how we used to be
I think about it everyday
But then I realized
I tried to tell you everything she did
It's time to let what we had go
There's only one thing left to say
I told you so"

Only in America could they kill a man that said I have a dream,
Or that would set the slaves free...
Only here, could they assassinate our own president because of a speech at the Waldorf-Astoria.
It's time you wake up, the coffee is getting cold, and the poisoned food has grown mold
The Fourth Reich runs the FDA, the Fed, and with malice they legislate.
The elite rich from the bible days still run the world today.
But wait... Then one day I woke up, and I could see...
The only hope now lays within you and me.
A toast to a new generation of art that is Political Heresy.,Yeah that's right... I guess It's up to you and me to wake the masses up from the Nightmare of the American Dream"

You turn and break my heart
Did I deserve your love?
It kills me inside to think of his arms
Wrapped around you now,
Is he a better lover than I?,Well I've been trying in vain

Stole from the world, guilty of my crime
How high can we both fly?
You answer so soft
That you could never be mine
Cuz everything's too complicated
But you wish we could be
It's wishful thinking that you will
Leave everything for me,
I know you're scared to get hurt
It may sound cliche but I'm here to stay
For you I will do whatever it takes, yeah.,I may be a fool
It doesn't really matter
As long as I'm with you
I don't seem to care
For now I'll just sit back for awhile
Wait for awhile...,Things got in the way
2 things got in the way
Those damn things get in the way

Solace in shadows and road lights

Drowning out my broken heart
Loneliness spreads it's arms

The sunrise wakes new life in me.
And every hour of every day I'm learning more,The more I learn, the less I know about before
The less I know, the more I want to look around
Digging deep for clues on higher ground
The fishes swim while rivers run
Thru fields to feast my eyes upon
Intoxicated drinking from
The loving cup of burning sun
In dreams I'll crave familiar taste
Of whispered rain on weary face
Of kisses sweet and warm embrace
Another time another place
And every hour of everyday I'm learning more
The more I learn, the less I know about before
The less I know, the more I want to look around
Digging deep for clues on higher ground"

""You might not remember me but I had one dance with you
And ever since the night we met, I must tell you true
You danced into my life, drove me out of my mind
Now between and me and my man it's all over"",That's what she said

'Cause the way with the woman there was no doubt
We would have to see eachother and it would not be long
Before we'd hit it off with a love that's strong, strong, strong
And I know someone out there is hurt, but got to get it on
It's natural that we were meant for eachother
If you run your life the way you dance
I'd be proud of that night I made my advance,She loves me now
And that just means I can't complain
She loves me now
And I must admit I feel the same
She loves me now

I'm better 'cause it isn't true,If I sport the latest cut of cloth
Would you all assume I'd got some style
And wear my hair just long enough
To turn the fashion heads for a while,A sports car sexy, slimline, fast
Quick enough to hide my past
Rich enough to open doors
I never could unlock before,I don't know, it seems to me
Things I do best come easily
I don't feel the need to say to you
I'm better 'cause it isn't true,'Cause it isn't true
'Cause it isn't true
'Cause it isn't true

Don't you worry yourself my dear
It's a long long way from here,Drought and famine in TV land
Read the sunday papers credit card ina your hand
Sing your song of freedom just to ease your troubled mind
And save your guilty pennies for the ones you leave behind,The burden that you carry from the cradle to the grave
Is like a badge of honour that you wear upon your sleeve
You make your contribution and you shed a little tear
And stage your celebration just to show how much you care,You obscure your stolen power with hypocrisy and lies
Your talk of understanding is a wafer thin disguise
You glorify my image but deny me flesh and blood
You radiate with goodness when you here me beg for food,Those rivers of blood will flow again
Someone changed the lyrics but the song remains the same
You can build a wall of protocol to keep the wolves at bay
But history dictates that someone has to pay,It's a long long way from here
Don't you worry yourself my dear
It's a long long way from here"

Spirit of the night
See the scourge of innocence
Swinging in her hand
Hear the silent suffering
That echoes through the land,From the tombs of ignorance
Of hate and greed and lies
Through the smoke of sacrifice
Watch her figure rise
The sick the poor the old
Basking in her radiance
Men of blood and gold,In her bloody footsteps
Speculators prance
Men of dreams are praying
For that second chance
Round her vacant features,
Gilded serpents dance
Her tree of evil knowledge
Sprouts a special branch,Madam medusa

And then she bounce right back
Knock her right down
And then she bounce right back

The highways quiet scars across the land.
People lie, eyes closed, no longer dreaming,
The earth dies screaming.
Like scattered pebbles, cars lie silent waiting,
Oilless engines seized by dirt and sand.
Bodies hanging limp, no longer bleeding,
The earth dies screaming.,The earth dies screaming
The earth dies screaming,
Your country needs you, lets strike up the band.,The earth dies screaming
The earth dies screaming
Despite all odds we must defend our land.,Half eaten meals lie rotting on the tables,
Money clutched within a boney hand.
Shutters down, the banks are not receiving,
The earth dies screaming."

Bloody deeds have been done in my name
Criminal acts we must pay for
And our children will shoulder the blame,(chorus)
I'm a British subject not proud of it
While I carry the burden of shame (repeat),As a nation we follow in blindness
No one stops to question why
Our money's supporting an army
And a boy in Soweto dies,(chorus)
I'm a British subject not proud of it
While I carry the burden of shame (repeat),Must we go on ignoring forever
The cries of an African son
There's a soldier's hand on a trigger
But it's we who are pointing the gun,(chorus)
I'm a British subject not proud of it
While I carry the burden of shame (repeat)"
